While these conclusions are somewhat questionable, they are not without merit. In particular, Quine's treatment of the Villa Savoye and the Domino House deserves special attention. Finally consider Gisele Urbanati Rowan Lell's far more controversial piece "Polypod Or Polylith?: The Navidson Creation As Mechanistic/ Linguistic Model" in Abaku Banner Catalogue, v. 198, January 1996, p. 515-597, in which she treats the" house-shifts" as evidence of polylithic dynamics and hence structure.

The knowledge that they are heading back keeps  Wax and Jed's spirits elevated. Holloway, however, remains uncharacteristically sallow, revealing what critic Melisa Tao Janis calls "a sign of [his] deepening, atrabilious obsession with the unpresent."154Nevertheless, the climb still proceeds smoothly, until Holloway discovers the remains of one of their foot long neon markers barely clinging to the wall.

He responds  as a hunter and the image that fills the frame is a weapon.

Soon enough he is stalking door- ways, leading the dancing moon of Jed's flashlight with the barrel of his rifle, and always listening.

"You hear it first in the distance, a gentle rumble, slowly growing louder as it descends, until finally it's all around you, sweeping over you, and then past you, until it's gone, a mile away, two miles away, impossi- ble to follow."156Esther Newhost in her essay "Music as Place in The Navid- son Record" provides an interesting interpretation of this sound: "Goethe once remarked in a letter to Johann Peter Eckermann (March 23, 1829]: 'I call architecture frozen music.'157 The unfreez- ing of form in the Navidson house releases that music. Unfortu- nately, since it contains all the harmonies of time and change, only the immortal may savor it. Mortals cannot help but fear those cur- murring walls. After all do they not still sing the song of our end?"I58For Holloway,  it  is  impossible to merely accept the growl asa quality of that place anymore. Upon seeing the torn marker and their lost water, he seems to transfigure the eerie sound into an utterance  made  by   some  definitive  creature,  thus  providing himI55In describing the Egyptian labyrinth, Pliny noted how "when the doors open there is a terrifying rumble of thunder within." xI56The Last Interview.151Jch die Baukunst eine erstarrte Musik nenne.158Esther Newhost's "Music as Place in The Navidson Recorcf' in The Many Wall Fugue,ed.

Their bodies ache from the constant cold. Their nerves have been eviscerated by the constant darkness. They are low on battery power (i.e. light), neon markers, and fishing line. Furthermore, the destroyed cache of supplies could indicate their other caches are in jeopardy. If that proves to be the case, they will not have enough water to even make it back within radio range of Navid-son.	"We're heading home now," Jed snaps."Fuck you," Holloway barks. "I give the orders here, and I say no one's going anywhere yet." Which considering the circumstances are  pretty  bizarre  words to be hearing in such regions of dark."Look dude," Wax tries, doing his best to lure Holloway over to their side of sense. "Let's just check in so we can resupply and, you know ... uh ... get more guns.""I will not abort this mission" Holloway responds sharply, jabbing an angry finger at the  twenty-six  year old from Aspen, Colorado.Easily as much attention has been given  to  Hol- use of the word "abort" as to Navidson's use ofthe word "outpost." The implication in "abort" is the failure to attain a goal-the prey not killed, the peak not climbed. As if there could have been a final  objective in that place. Initially Holloway's only goal  was  to  reach the bottom of  the  staircase  (which  he  achieved). Whether it was the growl or the expurgating qualities of the house or something  entirely else,  Holloway decided  to redefine that goal mid-way. Jed and Wax, however, understand that to begin hunting some elusive presence124 now is just the same as suicide. Without another word, they both tum around and start heading back to the stairs.Holloway refuses to follow them. For a while, he rants and raves, screaming profanities at a blue streak, until finally and abruptly,  he just storms  off  by  himself,  vanishing into  the black-ness.    It  is another  peculiar event  which  is over almost before it U<JZ!..L za nSp p o	·s, 1 p n7 lf:JJ.1pa 1.1.1 uuvl(0f ·v.11a t1JJO ap i11Ua:JJA sna w w'JU0WN 9/0:J:JJN 'JSiJUV.IJcl VISJ11V([ JUUVtl0J!)

No sign of Holloway, a terrifying short- age of supplies, and a very ugly decision to make.Hank Leblarnard has devoted several pages on the guilt both men suffered when they decided to head back without Hol- loway. 160 Nupart Jhunisdakazcriddle also analyzes the tragic nature of their action, pointing out that in the end, "Holloway chose his course.

Consider what happened to an explorer entering the Sarawak Chamber discovered in the Mulu mountains in Borneo. This chamber measures 2,300ft long, 1,300ft wide, averages a height of 230ft, and is large enough to contain over 17 football fields. When first entering the chamber, the party of explorers kept close to a wall assuming incorrectly that they were following a long, wind- ing passageway. It was only when they chose to return by striking straight out into that blackness-expecting to run into the opposite waU-that they discovered the monstrous size of that cavern: "So the trio marched out into the dark expanse, maintaining a com- pass course through a maze of blocks and boulders until they reached a level, sandy plain, the signature of an underground chamber. The sudden awareness of the immen- sity of the black void caused one of the cavers to suffer an acute attack of agoraphobia, the fear of open spaces. None of the three would later reveal who panicked, since silence on such matters is an unwritten law among cavers." Planet Earth: Underground Worldsp. 26-27.Of course, Holloway's reactions exceed a perfectly understandable case of ago- raphobia.160Hank Lebla.mard's Grie.fs Explorations (Atlanta: More Blue Publications, 1994).125 I.U/i11(/!A1 'p.iVUXJ,P /i11(:J!W-a u a1c1 'MossnJ l(:JJJUJcJH 'iflJ!!) 1,f:JJ-'PiJJ.ld 'JU!/.li1f,V 'f!UJUJ0G '.wusw J/0Jcl UV!JS_Ulf:J 'J'f:JJqn')/ qn'fVf 'UJV.1.107 a7 l(di1SOf-S!n07'p .i!JtlSUi1.ll(3 1snSnv [JV:) '.ia dJcl snuSvw 'f!-'Pi1-':J 'tl0UiJl(ZV([ l(:JJtl0UVtl/ 11.,mA 't10Jv1s lf:J!t10J0Sa,{_UVtl/ 'Jl(SUaJvno 0UJ0:JVJ!)·	IO'fVZVX l{:JJtl0.i0p oa .1 JiJt11Vf,V 'U0JiJUJV:) SiJ/.lVlf:J 'uos1uvy Ja 1ac1 'uos.1effaf SVUJ0l(.L 'l(:JU!fiJn([ SiJ/.IVlf:J 'U01U.101f.L wvmJM '1a 11vn  a uua 113'ppifpvy a S.1oa9 'aqoJ1V7UJUJVfua g 'i1U!V1U0,1 p.iVU0?7-SJ0:JUV.ld'.ia p .li1cl SiJ[JVl(:J 'UJ.13/Vlf:J:L'd 'V 'f/-'011!H awuSJ-a nb:JvJ 'a1snoJqV7 _uua y-SJ0:JUV.l:J-i1Ui1Jcl ':Jna1fda so1 -s1n07 '.ia ifopnvA uoa 7 '.iawa JpnvA i1[!"'3-a ,snSnv l(diJSOf '.iaJUJV!)Si1/.lVl(:J -i1SJn07 -UViJf 'p.iVl[V([ JOP!A 'p UVl(dJ V"V':J'f 'pa , na p UVUJP-' "d 'teffi3 i1t1V1Sn!)

An hour later, Jed and Wax reach another cache,placed out of the way against the wall at the far end of a stair, near the entrance to some unexplored corridor. Nothing remains of the food and fuel but the jug  of water is perfectly intact. Wax is back for a second chug, when the crack of a rifle drops him to the floor, blood immediately gushing from his left armpit."Oh my god! Oh my god!" Wax screams. "My arm-Oh god Jed help me, I'm bleeding!" Jed immedi- ately crouches next to Wax's side and applies pressure to the wound. Moments later, Holloway emerges from the dark corridor with his rifle in hand. He seems just as shocked by the sight of these two as he is by the sight of the stairs."How the hell did I get here?" he blurts out inco-herently. "I thought it was that, that thing. Fuck. It was that thing. I'm sure of it. That awful fucking ... fuck, fuck.""Don't stand there. Help him!" Jed yells. This seems to snap Holloway out of his trance-at least for a little while. He helps Jed peal off Wax's jacket and treat the wound. Fortunately  they  are not unprepared.  Jed has a medical supply kit loaded with gauze,  ace bandages, disinfectant, ointments, and some painkillers. He forces two pills into Wax's mouth but the ensuing cut161 Nupart Jhunisdakazcriddle's Killing Badly, Dying Wise (London: Apophrades Press, 1996), p. 92.126 shows that only some of Wax's agony has subsided.Jed starts to tell Holloway what they will have to do in orderto carry Wax the remainder of the way up. '!lu-mpo:J 1.wq o'lf SuJJVlf:J 'AJJVf[ SiJ/JVl(:J JJS 'tfJJVf[ "JV·g 'u!2nJ iJJOUJl(]JONtfq/uM s  ms n2nv '1,m1s punwpg u2JOiJD'UO]XVJ l(diJSOf J.IS 'SiJUOfUiMIQMVl(S Ul)UJJON "Are you crazy?"

Holloway's helmet light reveals that he is stand- ing on the opposite side of the stairway.Jed instantly turns off his flashlight and with Wax on  his back scrambles up a few stairs. Then by rapidly clicking his flash- light on and off, he discovers a narrow hallway branching off the stairway into unseen depths.

Occasionally we hear the faint crack of a rifle shot in the distance,  causing Jed  to push ahead even faster, darting through as many chambers as pos- sible, until  his  breath rasps painfully in  and  out of his  lungs and heis  forced  to  put  his  friend  down,  unable  for  the moment  to go anyfarther. '011onN opWJE['wa1s 011avfJV'lf 'JaJpVJVA addas n!D 'Juo2uaw addas n!D 'pJoj t1WJ:J UO!JVJtV'l(:JO')/ OUV/WD'_IUJJup/V:J OUJ/u!f2n9'o:J_11v111as as ua1s3 0J1iJ!d 'O]JOf[ 0/l!UJIJ:)'s_1Jqv3 ap omw3 'uasuvy'fJJJupuJ:J U1JJ1SJJl{:J'l/Oqs apUJf[ JuU'>fJJf{qan1109  'l(:JSOJD l(:JJ UJiJHuv11s_1Jl(:J '1aEu3 2_t1Hpn7/JTJ:) 'uaSp/VMJOlf.L/ulJiJf[ 'UJ(!JlSUiJJl{'311,f:JiJJqfVUlJl(Of  '.IZZIJ.10:J OJU01UV'UJll'>f.lUOJOAl(:J_il\OJOf i>f!NJa.1puv'UOUJOl(.Lap SIJUJOl{.L 'IIOJ1Jlf'f1JZ l(:JJliJ!.11/UJU UTJJJPJ-1'JSSO'l{ l(:JJIIOUIJII/1.1vy 'puvJJaftuo/tVap pJV:J!'lf  a1sn8nvl{J_li\OJ1iJJ !l!SIJA 'JPJ1J/!D sob. Jed just slides to the floor, turns off his light, and starts to O:JJUaUJoa '11atfJ02JJDtfs vuvf v 's_1v11nvaud1s o 'UOlf.L l(:J!lliJiJJPUV UJ1U1J]SUO')/'p 0011JiJl(S 127 l{:JJIIOd!SSQ JJUJJPTJ/A'uasuvy uv_11s_J1l(:J  suvy 'uas uvy pJvnpg Sn!!lfdOalf.L 'Jamz JSUJ'3']JiJIJfuOJ l(dasor 'S.1adtfn:Js m.1aqny   snlfdasor sm1aJ 'aqoJ11J7 u_1wv(uau coin's Inn Fields, the Consols Office in the Bank of England, the plan of Foothill Abbey, the Cupola Room at Heaton Hall, the Dublin Four Courts. the Somerset House in London, the Casino at Marino House in Dublin. the Pagoda at Kew Gardens, Stowe House portico at Buckinghamshire. drawing room at 20 St. James' Square, Middlesex Syon House, Marble Hall at Kedleston, Temple of Ancient Virtue in the Stowe Elysian Fields, staircase at 44 Berkeley Square, Holkham Hall in Norfolk. the cupola room in Kens- At 3:31 A.M. the camera blips on again.

And for the life of me I didn't know who she was or where we'd met.	For a moment I wondered if she was that voice.	But before she said even a word, she held my hand and led me through her house to a patio overgrown with banana trees and rubber plants.	Black, decomposing leaves covered the ground but a large hammock hung above it all.We sat down together and I wanted to talk.	I wanted to ask her who she was, where we'd met,  been before,  but she just smiled and held my hand as we sat down on the hammock and started to swing above all those dead leaves.

Wilkerson, M.D. (Seattle: The Mountaineers, 1985), p. 43:"Mild shock results from loss of ten to twenty perce nt of blood volume. The patient appears pale and his skin feels cool, first over the extremities and later over the trunk. As shock becomes more severe, the patient often complains of feeling cold and he is often thirsty. A rapid pulse and reduced blood  pressure  may  be  present.  However,  the absence of these signs does not indicate shock is not present since they may appear rather late, particularly in previously healthy young adults. "Moderate shock results from loss of twenty to forty percentof the blood volume. The signs characteristic of mild shock are presentand may become more severe. The pulse is typically fast and weak or 'thready.' In  addition,  blood  flow to the kidneys is reduced as the available blood is shunted to the heart and brain and the urinary output declines. A urinary volume of less than 30 cc per hour is a late indication of moderate shock. In contrast to the dark, concentrated urine observed with dehydration, the urine is usually a light color."Severe shock results from loss of more than forty percent  of the blood volume and is characterized by signs of reduced blood  flow to the brain and heart. Reduced cerebral blood flow initially produces rest- lessness and agitation, which is followed by confusion, stupor and even- tually coma and death. Diminished blood flow to the heart can produce abnormalities of the cardiac rhythm." OW.JON '.latfaw<JJN .io;,so '8U!/-'!IS StJUilJf '/1;,qdWD:)JV uosns •u aqdUllJ:) f 11apuaM ':it SUOWUl!S tf.i.ion 'wn.1a8.ioJV M.ia80N '.lau.ioA "N p/0JDH 'SUIJS :.,J plDM0H ')f.10/:)-011DJV uop.109 'UDM0Dsawof 'uosq11ws .1a1ad 'a;,uads [!SlJfl .I.IS 'unps07 stfuaa "!S '1;,a.11s.1a11O·1 tf.l.llJH 'UJJ.IOJVausry -'!S 'U0SJPDJV "d 1.1;,qoN '11;,u.1nd·3 oqs.1ow ';J'fnaSo/.lDlf:J 'xono.111;,a ',fa[1_1lfM ;,;,tfof "N 'tfa/J!lfM N WD!l/!M ifi'Jll!lfM"JV  Si'JUIOf  'lfdJopnN tnDd'X0U)I  UJ0:JU!7  'P!-'"P0N'UlfD)I s,n07 '.la11n.1.1a1su_1Ul'f:Jnf[ 'uauJJDDS 0.1;,3 'U0Z1fl U.18('!11.l<JN J81n7 'p.iouua)I/Ji'JqoN ':if puog XDJVf 'uo18u!lfSDM 01.1;,qoN '.lazJ!MS no7 '01/DV .IDIIJV '0UIJ!d 0ZU;JJN 'SJ<J80Np.1oq:J.1N '.la1so3 uow.ioN '8UJJ-'!IS StJUIIJf '!lnlUi'JA1.1aqoN '11uo9 ·g tfa11.10H 'aSOlf:) "S Ulf0f 'SIJ0lf/00)/ 133 waN 'U!<JI/0H SUDH'U0SUlf0f dJ/!l/d 'Jlf0N .1;,p Hagia Sophia, Ravenna's interior of the Mau- soleum of Galla Placidia, Rome's S.

This gross underestimation of bis opponent cost Que- sada his life.Like a general, Magellan rallied those men still loyal to him to retake the comman- deered ships. The combination of his will and his tactical acumen made his success, espe- cially in retrospect, seem  inevitable. The mutineer  Mendoza of the  Victoria  was stabbed in the throat. The Santo Antonia was stormed, and by morning the Concepcion had sur- rendered. Forty-eight hours after the mutiny had  begun,  Magellan  was  again  in  control. He sentenced all the mutineers to death and then in an act of calculated good-will sus- pended the sentence, choosing instead to concentrate maritime law and his own ire  on  the three directly responsible for the uprising: Mendoza's corpse was drawn and quartered,Juan de Cartagena was marooned on a barren shore and Quesada was executed.Quesada, how- ever, was not hung, shot or even forced to walk the  plank.  Magellan had a better idea. Molino, Quesada's trusty servant, was granted clemency if he agreed to execute bis master.	Molino accepted the duty and135 puo anSJD 'VMTJ'f0.Jn){0lfSJ){ 'J'fVZOSJ IV.JV'/IJIIJu/l!M uvar ',(.Jl(a9 'f_UV.J,!l 'J.Jafias UJq0¥ '/\\;J.Ja 'El auvr '2.Jaquaa.19 uv11 v 'tf.J.Ja.L UV/U.tnQ 'pUJ'fSaq17 1aJuva '1a1.103 uoUJV¥ ''f.Jaqtfz-.Ja]OIJ lfJaqoZJ/3 puv 'tfurma sa.Jpuv 'v.imaN P.JVl(:JJ¥ '.t;JJ.J){ uon 'l !0Hua11a1s 'uosdUJ!S Ulf0['!l!fDEf op.JV:J!¥ ',<qaau //DH svwDlf.L sv sawvu l(:Jns01 paalf 2uJ,(vd mDl(1Jil\ '-:J1a '·:J1a S'f.J0M :Juqnd 'sa11p puv 'SU/\W] ua11a 'S'f.JVd 's1uawnuow '1uaU1Vff.JVdJo susnoH 'snifJo;J_lfqndpuv 'SaJ.J1SJUJUJ 'S].Jn0:J MO/ 'Sl!Vlf UM0J's1.1od.1Jv 'sa2pJ.Jq 'S.al(:J.Jnl{:J 'sa.11val{1 's.aJ.iv.iqu 'SUJn;JSnUI 'S/VJJdS.Olf'sUOSJ.Jd 'S/aJ0lf 'S'fUVq puv 's.a2umpxa 's2u_1pnnq a:J![fo puv '1wsno11a.10M 'suo.1101s ,<vM/JV.J 's2uJp/!nq uomqJl(Xa 'S;JJ.JOJVII.J;JSU0:J 'Sl !VlfJiJ'f.JVUJ 'sa.101s 1uaw1.iodap 'S;J.J0]S 'sdOl(S 'S;JJ.J01WJ 'S;JUI0lf Jo .J;Jl{J;JlfM 'U0J]:Jn.J]SU0;J Jo /.JDS,<uv .iapJSU0:J 01 a1q1ssodiuJSJ 1!

I?ILike Magellan, Holloway led an expedition into the unknown. Like Magellan, Holloway faced a mutiny. And like the captain who meted out a penalty of death, Holloway also centred the cross-hairs .   _____________		...... upon those who bad spurned his leadership. However unlike Mag- ellan, Holloway's course was in fact doomed, thus necessitating a look at Henry Hudson's fate.D.By April of 1610, Hudson left England in his fourth attempt to find the northwest passage.  He headed west across arctic waters and  eventually ended  up   in what is known today as  the  Hudson  Bay.  Despite  its  innocuous  sounding name, back in 1610 the bay was Hell in ice. Edgar M. Bacon in his book Henry Hudson (New York: G.P. Putnam's Sons, 1907) writes the following:On the first of November the ship was brought to a bay or inlet far down into the south-west, and hauled aground;  and there by the tenth  of  the month she was frozen in. Discontent was no longer expressed in whispers. The men were aware that the provisions, laid in for a limited number of months, were running to an  end,  and  they  murmured  that they had not been taken back for winter quarters to Digges Island, where such stores of wild fowl had been seen,  instead  of  beating  about  for months in "a labyrinth without end."[italics added for emphasis]This labyrinth of blue ice drifting in water cold enough to kill a man in a couple of minutes tested and finally outstripped the resolve of Hudson's crew. Where Magellan's men could fish or at least enjoy the cove of some habitable shore, Hudson's men could only stare at shores of ice.180Inevitably, whispers rose to shouts until finally shouts followed action. Hud- son, along with his son and seven others,  was  forced  into  a shallop  without food and water. They were never heard from again, lost in that labyrinth with136 1mpena , or mansar ; no westwor , ziggu rat, brise-soleil, trompe l'oeil etc., fenestra tion, tierceron rib, coffering, tholo strapwork, stoa, egg-and-tongue, sala ter rena, absidiole, rotunda, revetments, rere dos,  flying  buttresses,  retablo,  he belvedere,	paviUon,	pastas,	narthex lunettes,   dormers,  cottage  orne,    penden 	    tives,  cheek-walls,  cavetto,  abutment,  no out end. 170Like Hudson, Holloway found himself   with men who, short on reserves and faith, insisted on turning back.

The incident never resulted in violence, but it does emphasize how despite constant contact with the society at home, plenty of food, water, and warmth, and  only a slight  risk  of getting lost, tensions among explorers can still surface and even escalate.Holloway's expedition had none of the amenities Skylab enjoyed. I) There was no radiocontact; 2) they had very little sense of where they were; 3) they were  almost out  of food and water; 4) they were operating in freezing conditions; and 5) they suffered the implicit threat of that 'growl' .1SS170Also see The Works of Hubert Howe Bancroft, Volume XXV/11 (San Francisco: The His- tory Company, Publishers, 1886).171Taken from Zampano' s journal: "As often as I have lingered on Hudson in his shallop, I have in the late hours turned my thoughts to Quesada and Molino's journey across those shallow waters, wondering aloud what they said, what they thought, what gods came to keep them or leave 1hem, and what in those dark waves they finally saw  of themselves? Per- haps because history has little to do with those minutes, the scene survives only in verse: The Song of Quesada and Molino by [XXXX].172 I include it here in its entirety."175Then:"Forgive me please for including this. An old man's mind is just as likely to wander as a young man's. but where a young man will forgive the stray, 177 an old man will  cut  it  out.  Youth always tries to fill the void, an old man learns to live with it. It took me twenty years tounlearn the fortunes found in a swerve. Perhaps this is no news to you but then I have killed many men and I have both legs and I don't think I ever quite equaled the bald gnome Error who comes from his cave with featherless ankles to feast on the mighty dead."173172nlegible.l73you got me.176 Gnome aside, I don't even know how to take 'I've killed many men.•  Irony?

Nor was such terror  van- quished by the modern age. Consider the  diary entry made in  1915  by Reginald James, expedition physicist for Shackleton's Endurance which was trapped and finally crushed by pack ice off the coast of Antarctica in the Weddell Sea: "A terrible night with the ship sullen dark against the sky & the noise of the pressure against her ... seeming like the cries of a living creature." See also Simon Alcazaba's Historic Conditions (Cleveland: Annwyl Co., Inc., 1963) as well as Jack Denton Scott's "Journey Into Silence" Playboy, August 1973, p. I02.138 For one thing, Hollywood films rely on sets, actors, expen- sive film stock, and lush effects to recreate a story. Production value  coupled  with the cultural saturation of trade gossip help ensure a modicum of disbelief, thus reaf- firming for the audi- ence, that no matter how moving, riveting, or terrifying a  film may be, it is still only entertainment. Docu- mentaries, however, rely on interviews, inferior equipment, and  virtually  no effects to document real events.1s1 Audi- ences are not allowed the safety net of dis- belief and  so  must tum to more challeng- ing mechanisms of interpretation  which, as is sometimes the case, may lead  to denial and aversion.1s2181Consider Stephen Mamber's definition of cinema verite which seems an almost exact description of how Navidson made his film:Cinema verite is a strict discipline only because it is in many ways so simple, so "direct." The filmmaker attempts to eliminate as much as possible the barriers between  subject  and  audience.  These  barriers are technical (large crews, studio sets, tripod-mounted equipment, special lights, costumes and makeup), procedural (scripting, acting, directing), and structural (standard editing devices,  traditional  forms of melodrama, suspense, etc.) Cinema verite is a practical working method based upon a faith of unmanipulated reality, a refusal to tamper with life as it presents itself.  Any kind of cinema is a process of selection, but there is (or should be) all the difference in the world between the cinema-verite aesthetic and the methods of fictional and traditional documentary film.Stephen Mamber, Cinema Verite in America: Studies in Uncontrolled Documentary (Cambridge, Massachu- setts: The MIT Press, 1974), p. 4.139 While		in		the past,	live		footage was limited to the aftermath-the oral histories  given		by survivors or pho- tographs taken by pedestrians-these days the prolifera- tion of affordable video cameras and tapes		has		created more of an opportu- nity for someone to record			a			plane wreck or bank rob- bery as it is actually taking place.Of	course, no documentary is everentirely absolved from at least the suspicion that the mise-en-scene may have been care- fully designed, actions staged, or lines written and rehearsed-much of which these days is openly carried out under the appellation of "reenactment."By now it is common knowledge that Flaherty recreated certain scenes in Nanook for the cam- era. Similar accusations have been made against shows like America's Funniest  Home    Videos. For the most part, pro- fessionals in the field do their best to police, or at least critique, the latest films, well aware that to lose the public's trust would mean the death rattle for an already besieged art form.  00::::-.c:;;·	.......  1-0 cr	....... ...,""O ::8   o   ::r =  (I)	::r	<» ::r <» ... ::s ..... ::no1M ihaqpunJD ,<pov 's;JUIJ.l 'f-'O.,{   M;JN  ;Jlf_.L     U! 0661 u1	SlllO()q(') Ill   @	@ C 3::s<»	- o(/) -o fllo.@g" oCT<» n, o.::sc c	.... 2.

It  takes us out of a chemical darkroom where sub- tle printing techniques such as burning and dodging have long been accepted as jour- nalistically sound. Today these terms are replaced by 'image manipulation· and 'enhancement.' In a time when such broad terms could be mis- construed we need to set limits and restate some basic tenets. A year later, the NPPA (National Press Photographers Associa- tion) also recognized the power of electronic imaging techniques:"As journalists we believe the guiding prin- ciple of our profession is accuracy: therefore, we believe it is  wrong  to alter the content of a photograph in a way that deceives the public.142 "As photojournal- ists, we have the responsibility to docu- ment society and to preserve its images as a matter of historical record. It is clear that the emerging electronic technologies provide new challenges to the integrity of photo- graphic images. The technology enables the manipulation of the content of an image in such a way that the change is virtually undetectable. In  light of this,  we, the National Press Pho- tographers Associa- tions, reaffirm the basis of our ethics: Accurate representation is the benchmark of our pro- fession."185Then in 1992, MIT professor William J. Mitchell offered this powerful summation: "Protagonists of the institu- tions of journalism, with their interest in being trusted, of the legal system, with their need for provably reliable evidence, and of science, with their foundational faith in the recording instrument, may well fight hard to maintain the hegemony of the standard photographic image-but others will see the emergence of digital imaging as a welcome opportu- nity to expose the aporias in pho- tography's construction of the visual world, to deconstruct the very ideas of photographic objec- tivity and closure, and to resist what has become an increasingly sclerotic pictorial tradition.

These days nothing deserves our faith less than the slick and expensive. Which is how video and film tech- nology comes to us: rum- pled or slick."Rumpled Technology--capital M for Mar- lowe-hails from Good Guys, Radio Shack or Fry's Electronics. It is cheap, available and very dangerous. One needs only to consider The George Holliday Rodney King Video to  recognize the power of such low- end technology. Further- more, as the recording time for tapes and digital disks increases, as battery life is extended, and as camera size is reduced, the larger the window will grow for capturing events as they occur."Slick Technology -capital S for Slick- is the opposite: expensive, cum- bersome, and time con- suming. But it too is also very powerful. Digital manipulation allows for the creation of almost anything the imagination can come up with, all  in the safe confines of an editing suite, equippedwith 24 hour catering and an on site masseuse." 186 As Grundberg, Alabiso and Mitchell contend, this impressive ability to manipulate images must someday permanently deracinate film and video from its now sacrosanct position as "eyewitness." The perversion of image will make The Rodney King Video inadmissible in a court  of  law . ,rinc	redible as it mayseem,  Los Angele	s Mayor Bradley's statement- "Ou	r  eyes   did	notdeceive  us.

Mitchell offers an alternate description of "grit" when he highlights Barthe's     observation     thatreality    incorporates   "seem- ingly	functionless 'because it is there' to detail signal that 'this is indeed an unfil- tered   sample     of     the real.' 191"192Kenneth Turan, however, disagrees with Lane's conclu- sion: "Navidson has  still relied on FIX. Don't fool yourself into thinking any of this stuff's true. Grit's just grit, and  the  room  stretching is  all care  of Industrial Light& Magic." Taylor,      Charles Ella Champlin, Todd McCarthy, Annette lnsdorf, G. 0. Pilfer, and Janet MasUn, all side- step the issue with a sentence or two. However, even  seri- ous aficionados of documen- taries or "live-footage," despite expressing wonder over the numerous details suggesting the veracity of The Navidson Record, cannot get past the absolute physical absurdity of the house.l91Roland Barthes' "The Reality Effect," in French Literary Theory Today  ed.

I 93I93Sonny Beauregard's "Worst of Times" The San Francisco Chronicle, July 4, 1995. C-7, column 2. Difficult to ignore here is the matter of that recent and most disturbing piece of work La Belle Nicoise et Le BeauChien. As many already know, the film portrayed the murder of a little girl in such comic reality it was instantly hailed as the belle  of  the ball in the palace of ihe grotesque, receiving awards at Sundance and Cannes, earning  international distri- bution deals, and enjoying the canonical company of David Lynch, Luis Buiiuel, Hieronymus Bosch, Charles Baudelaire, and even the Marquis De Sade, until of course it was discovered that there really was such a little Lithuanian girl and she really was murdered and by none other than the wealthy filmmaker himself. rt  was a slickly produced snuff film sold as an art house flick. Emir Kusturica's Underground fin- ally replaced Nicoise as the winner of the Cannes  Palm d'Or; an equally absurd and terrifying film though gratefully fictive. About Yugoslavia.The Navidson Record looks like a gritty, shoestring documentary. La Belle Nicoise et Le Beau Chien looks like a lushly executed piece of cin- ema. Both pieces are similar in  one way: what one  could believe one doubts, Nicoise because one depends upon the moral sense  of the  film- maker, The Navidson Record because one depends upon the moral sense of the world. Both are assumptions nei- ther film deserves. As Murphy Gruner might have observed: "Rum- pled vs. Slick. Your choice."147 Perhaps the best  argument for the authenticity of The Navidson Record does not come from film critics, university schol- ars, or festival panel members but rather from the I.R.S. Even a cur- sory glance at Will Navidson's tax statements or for that matter Karen's, Tom's or Billy Reston's, proves the impossibility of digital manipulation. 194They just never had enough money.Sonny Beauregard conserva- tively estimates the  special  effects in The Navidson Record would cost a minimum of six and a half mil- lion dollars. Taking into  account the total received for the Guggen- heim Fellowship, the NEA Grant, everyone's credit limit on Visa, Mastercard, Amex etc., etc., not to mention savings and equity, Navid- son comes up five and a half mil- lion dollars short. Beauregard again: "Considering the cost of special effects these days, it is inconceivable how Navidson could have created his house."J94The records were made public in the Phillip Newharte article "The House The I.R.S. Didn't Build" pub- lished in Seattle Photo Zine v.12, I 18, p.92-156.148 Strangely then, the best argument for fact is the absolute unaffordability of fiction. Thus it would appear the ghost haunting The Navidson Record, continually bashing against the door, is none other thanthe recurring threat of its own reality.195coat are gone.	I don't know why.

But  at  the  same  time, in its relation to the surrounding space, it is a "goal",  and we either advance toward this goal or depart from it.- Dagobert FreyGrundlegung zu einer vergleichenden KunstwissenschaftKaren may lose herself in resentment and fear, but the Navidson we see seems joyful, even euphoric, as he sets out with Reston and his brother to rescue Holloway and his team. It is almost as if entrance let alone a purpose-any purpose-in the face of those endless and lightless regions is reason enough to rejoice.153 Using 16mm motion picture (colour and B/W) and 35mm stills, Navidson for the first time begins to capture the size and sense of that place. Author Denise Lowery writes the following evocative impression of how Navidson photographs the Anteroom:The hot red flame spits out light, catching on Tom, entwining in the spokes of Reston's wheelchair,     casting    Shape    Changers	and Dragons on a nearby wall. But even this  wa- tery dance  succeeds  in  only  illuminating  a tiny portion of a comer. Navidson, Tom and Reston continue forward  beneath those ga- bles of gloom and walls  buttressed  with shadow, lighting more flares, penetrating this world with their halogen lamps,  until  finally what seemed undefinable comes forth out  of the shimmering blank,  implacable and now nothing    less   than	obvious	and	undeni- able-as if there never could have been a question about the shape, there never could have been a moment when only the imagina- tion succeeded in prodding those inky folds, coming up with its own sense, something far more perverse and contorted and heavy with things much stranger and colder  than  even this brief shadow play performed in the ir- regular bum  of sulfur-mythic  and  inhuma n , flickering, shifting, and  finally dying around the men's continuous progress. 199 199see chapter ten of Denise Lowery's Sketches: The Process of Emry (Fayetteville, Arkansas: University of Arkansas Press, 1996).154 Of course, the Great HalJ dwarfs even this chamber. As Holloway reported in Exploration #2, its span  approaches  one  mile,  making it practically impossible to illuminate. Instead the trio slips straight through the black, carefully marking their way with  ample  fishing  line,  untiJ  the  way ahead suddenly reveals an even greater darkness, pitted in the centre of that immense, incomprehensible space.In one photograph of the Great Hall, we find Reston in the fore-ground holding a flare, the light barely  licking  an  ashen  wall  rising  above him into inky oblivion, while in the background Tom stands surrounded by flares which just as ineffectually confront the impenetrable  wall of nothingness looming around the Spiral Staircase.As Chris Thayil remarks: "The Great Hall feels like  the  inside  of some preternatural hull designed to travel vast seas never before observed  in this world."200200Chris Thayil's "Travel's Legacy" in National Geographic, v. I89, May 1996, p. 36-53.155 Since rescuing Holloway's team is the prime objective, Navidson talces very few photographs. Luckily for us, however, the beginning of this sequence relies almost entirely on these scarce but breathtalcing stills instead of the far more abundant but vastly inferior video tapes, which are used here mainly to provide sound.156 Eventually when they realize Holloway and his team are nowhere near the Great Hall, the plan becomes for Reston to set up camp at the top of the stairway while Navidson and Tom continue on below.Switching to Hi 8, we follow Navidson and Reston as they react to Tom's announcement."Bullshit," Navidson barks at his brother. "Navy, I can't go down there," Tom stammers."What's that supposed to mean? You're just giving up on them?"Fortunately, by barely touching his friend's arm, Billy Reston forces Navidson to take a good hard look at his brother. As we can see for ourselves, he is pale, out of breath, and in spite of the cold, sweating profusely. Clearly in no condition to go any further let alone tackle the profound depths of that staircase.157 Navidson takes a deep breath. "Sorry Tom, I didn't mean to snap at you like that."Tom says nothing."Do you think you can stay here with Billy or do you want to head home? You'll have to make it back on your own.""I' II stay here.""With Billy?" Reston responds. "What's that supposed to mean?The hell if you think I'm letting you go on alone."But Navidson has already started down the Spiral Staircase."I should sue the bastards who designed this house," Reston shouts after him. "Haven't they heard of handicap ramps?"158 The dark minutes start to slide by. Based on Holloway's descent, Navidson had estimated the stairway was an incredible thirteen miles down. Less than five minutes later, however, Tom and Reston hear a shout. Peering over the banister, they discover Navidson with a lightstick in his hand standing at the bottom-no more than 100ft down. Tom immediately assumes they have stumbled upon the wrong set of stairs.Further investigation by Navidson, though, reveals the remnants of neon trail markers left by Holloway's team.159 Without another word, Reston swings out of his chair and starts down the stairs. Less than twenty minutes later he reaches the last step.Navidson knows he has no choice but to accept Reston's participa- tion, and heads back up to retrieve the wheelchair and the rest of their gear.160 Amazingly enough, Tom seems fine camping near the staircase.Both Navidson and Reston hope his presence will enable them to maintain radio contact for a much longer time than Holloway could. Even if they both know the house will still eventually devour their signal.161 As Navidson and Reston head out into the labyrinth, they occasionally come upon pieces of neon marker and shreds of various types of fishing line. Not even multi-strand steel line seems immune to the diminishing effects of that place."It looks like its impossible to leave a lasting trace here," Navidson observes."The woman you never want to meet," quips Reston, always managing to keep his wheelchair a little ahead of Navidson.162 Soon, however, Reston begins to suffer from nausea, and even vomits. Navidson asks him ifhe is sick. Reston shakes his head."No, it's more ... shit, I haven't felt this way since I went fishing for marlin."163 Navidson speculates Reston's sea sickness or his "mal de mer," as he calls it, may have something to do with the changing nature of the house: "Everything here is constantly shifting. It took Holloway, Jed, and Wax almost four days to reach the bottom of the staircase, and yet we made it down in five minutes. The thing collapsed like an accordion." Then looking over at his friend: "You realize if it expands again, you're in deep shit.""Considering our supplies," Reston shoots back. "I'd say we'd bothbe in deep shit."164 As was already mentioned in Chapter ill, some critics believe the house's mutations reflect the psychology of anyone who enters it. Dr. Haugeland asserts that the extraordinary absence of sensory information forces the individual to manufacture his or her own data.201 Ruby Dahl, in her stupendous study of space, calls the house on Ash Tree Lane " a solipsistic heightener," arguing that "the house, the halls, and the rooms all become the self-collapsing, expanding, tilting, closing, but always inperfect relation to the mental state of the individual."202201 M issin g.- Ed. 202Ibid. Curiously Dahl fails to consider why the house never opens into what is necessarily outside of itself.165 If one accepts Dahl's reading, then it follows that Holloway's creature comes from Holloway's mind not the house; the tiny room Wax finds himself trapped within reflects his own state of exhaustion and despair; and Navidson's rapid descent reflects his own knowledge that the Spiral Staircase is not bottomless. As Dr. Haugeland observes:The epistemology of the house remains en- tirely commensurate with  its  size.  After  all, one always approaches the unknown with greater caution the first time around. Thus it appears far more expansive than it literally is. Knowledge of the terrain on a second visit dramatically contracts this sense of distance.Who has never gone for a walk through some unfamiliar park  and  felt  that  it  was huge, only to return a second time to discover that the park is in fact much smaller than ini- tially perceived?166 When revisiting places we once fre- quented as children, it is not unusual to observe how much smaller everything seems. This experience has too often been attributed to the physical differences between a child and an adult. In fact it has more to do with epistemological dimensions than with bodily dimensions: knowledge is hot water on wool. It shrinks time and space.(Admittedly there is the matter whereboredom, due to repetition, stretches time and space. I will deal specifically with this prob- lem in a later chapter entitled "Ennui."203)When Holloway's team traveled down the stairway, they had no idea if they would find a bottom. Navidson, however, knows the stairs are finite and therefore has far less anxiety about the descent.203See also Dr. Helen Hodge's American Psychology: The Ownership Of Self (Lexington: University of Kentucky Press, 1996), p. 297 where she writes:What is boredom? Endless repetitions, like, for example, Navidson's corridors and rooms, which are consistently devoid of any Myst-like discoveries ( see Chad; p. 99 • J thus causing  us  to  lose  interest.  What  then  makes anything exciting? or better yet: what is exciting? While the degree varies, we are always excited by anything that engages us, influences us or more simply involves us. In those endlessly repetitive hallways and stairs, there is nothing for us to connect with. That pennanently foreign place does not excite us. It bores us. And that is that, except for the fact that there is no such thing as boredom. Boredom is really a psychic defense protecting us from ourselves, from complete paralysis, by repressing, among other things, the meaning of that place, which in this case is and always has been horror.See also Otto Fenichel's 1934 essay "The Psychology of Boredom" in which he describes boredom as "an unpleasurable experience of a lack of impulse." Kierkegaard goes a little further, remarking that "Boredom, extinction, is precisely a continuity of nothingness." While William Wordsworth in his preface for Lyrical Ballads   ( 1802) writes:The subject is indeed important! For the human mind is capable of being excited without the application of gross and violent stimulants; and he must have a very faint perception of its beauty and dignity who does not know this, and who does not further know, that one being is elevated above another, in proportion as he possesses this capability ... [A] multitude of causes, unknown to former times, are now acting with a combined force to blunt the discriminating powers of the mind, and unfitting it for all voluntary exertion to reduce it to a state of almost savage torpor. The most effective of these causes are the great national events which are daiJy taking place, and the increasing accumulation of men in cities, where the unifonnity of their occupations produces a craving for extraordinary incident, which the rapid communication of intelligence hourly gratifies. To this tendency of life and manners the literature and theatrical exhibitions of the country have confonned themselves.See Sean Healy's Boredom, Self and Culture (Rutherford, NJ.: Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 1984); Patricia Meyer Spacks' Boredom: The Literary History of a State of Mind (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1995); and finally Celine Arlesey's Perversity In Dullness . . . and Vice-Versa (Denver: Blederbiss Press, 1968).167 Unlike the real world, Navidson's jour- ney into the house is not just figuratively but literally shortened.204204Missing. - Ed.168 This theme of structures altered by perception is not uniquely observed in The Navidson Record. Almost thirty years ago, Gunter Nitschke described what he termed "experienced or concrete space":It has a centre which is perceiving man, and it therefore has an excellent system of direc- tions which changes with the movements of the human body; it is limited and in no sense neutral, in other words it is finite, heteroge- neous, subjectively defined and perceived; distances and directions are fixed relative toman .. _205205Giinter Nitschke's "Anatomie der gelebten Umwelt" (Bauen + Wohnen, September 1968).206206which you are quite right to observe makes no sense at all.169 Christian Norberg-Schulz objects; condemning subjective architec- tural experiences for the seemingly absurd conclusion it suggests, mainly that "architecture comes into being only when experienced."207207Christian Norberg-Schulz, Existence, Space & Architecture, p. 13.170 Norberg-Schulz asserts: "Architectural space certainly exists inde- pendently of the casual perceiver, and has centres and directions of its own."

It is only when focusing on Navidson's house that these assertions begin to blur.171 Can Navidson's house exist without the experience of itself?172 Is it possible to think of that place as "unshaped" by human perceptions?173 Especially since everyone entering there finds a v1s1on almost completely-though pointedly not completely-different from anyone else's?174 Even Michael Leonard, who had never heard of Navidson's house, professed a belief in the "psychological dimensions of space." Leonard claimed people create a "sensation of space" where the final result "in the perceptual process is a single sensation-a 'feeling' about that particular place ...

Piaget and B. lnhelder's The Child's Conception of Geometry (New York: Basic Books, 1960), p. 6.177 Where Navidson's house is concerned, subjectivity seems more a matter of degree. The Infinite Corridor, the Anteroom, the Great Hall, and the Spiral Staircase, exist for all, though their respective size and even layout sometimes changes. Other areas of that place, however, never seem to replicate the same pattern twice, or so the film repeatedly demonstrates.178 No doubt speculation will continue for a long time over what force alters and orders the dimensions of that place. But even if the shifts turn out to be some kind of absurd interactive Rorschach test resulting from some peculiar and as yet undiscovered law of physics, Reston's nausea stilJ reflects how the often disturbing disorientation experienced within that place, whether acting directly upon the inner ear or the inner labyrinth of the psyche, can have physiological consequences.2 11181 Fortunately Reston's nausea does not last long, and he and Navidson can spend the rest of the day pushing deeper and deeper into the labyrinth.Initially, they follow the scant remains of the first team and then continue on by following their instincts. Based on the fact that there was very little evidence of the first team's descent remaining on the stairs, Navidson determines that the neon markers and fishing line last at most six days before they are entirely consumed by the house.182 When they finally make camp, both men are disheartened and exhausted. Nevertheless, each agrees to alternately serve as watch.Navidson takes the first shift, spending his time removing the dark blotched gauze around his toes-clearly a painful process-before reapplying ointment and a fresh dressing. Reston spends his time tinkering with his chair and the mount on the Arriflex.Except for their own restlessness, neither one hears anything during the night.183 Toward the end of their second day inside (making this the ninth day since Holloway's team set out into the house), both men seem uncertain whether to continue or return.184 It is only as they are making camp for the second night that Navidson hears something. A voice, maybe a cry, but so fleeting were it not for Reston's confirmation, it probably would have been shrugged off as just a high note of the imagination.185 Leaving most of their equipment behind, the two men head out in pursuit of the sound. For forty minutes they hear nothing and are about to give up when their ears are again  rewarded  with another distant cry. Based on the rapidly changing video time stamp, we can see another three hours passes as they weave in and out of more rooms and corridors, often moving very quickJy, though never failing to mark their course with neon arrows and ample amounts of fishing line.186 At one point, Navidson manages to get Tom on the radio, only to learn that there is something the matter with Karen. Unfortunately, the signal decays before he can get more details. Finally, Reston stops his wheelchair and jabs a finger at a wall. On Hi 8, we witness his gruff assertion: "How we get through it, I don't have a clue. But that crying's coming from the other side."187 Searching out more hallways,  more turns, Navidson eventually leads the way down a narrow conidor ending with a door. Navidson and Reston open it only to discover another corridor ending with another door. Slowly they make their way through a gauntlet of what must be close to fifty doors (it is impossible to calculate the exact number due to the jump cuts), until Navidson discovers for the first and only time a door without a door knob. Even stranger, as he tries to push the door open, he  discovers it  is locked. Reston's expression communicates nothing but incredulity.212212See Gaston Bachelard's La Poetique de L'Espace (Paris: Presses Universitaires de France, 1978), p. 78, where he observes:Frarn;:oise Minkowska a expose une collection particulierement emou- vante de dessins d'enfants polonais ou juifs qui ont subi les sevices de!'occupation allemande pendant la demiere guerre. Telle enfant qui a vecu cache, a la moindre alerte, dans une armoire, dessine longtemps apres les heures maudites, des maisons etroites, froides et fermees. Et c'est ainsi que Fran9oise Minkowska parle de "maisons immobiles," de maisons immobi- lisees dans leur raideur: "Celle raideur et cette immobilite se retrouveot aussi bien a la fumee que dans les rideaux des fenetres. Les arbres autour d'elle sont droits, ont !'air de la garder."... A un detail, la grande psychologue qu'etait Fran9oise Minkowska re- connaissait le mouvement de la maison. Dans la maison dessinee par un enfant de huit ans, Fran9oise Minkowska note qu'a la porte, ii ya "uoe poi- gnee; on y entre, on y habite." Ce n'est pas simplement une maison- construction, "c'est une maison-habitation." La poignee de la porte designe evidemment une fonctionnalite. La kinesthesie est marquee par ce signe, si souvent oublie dans les dessins des enfants "rigides."Remarquons bien que la "poignee" de la porte  ne  pourrait guere etredessinee a l'echelle de la maison.
