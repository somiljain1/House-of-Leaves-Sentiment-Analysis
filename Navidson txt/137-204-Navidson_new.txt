In order to fully appreciate the way the ambages unwind, twist only to rewind, and then open up again, whether in Navidson's house or the tilm-quae itinerum ambages occursusque ac recursus inexplicabiles 136-we should look to the etymological inheritance of a word like 'labyrinth'
The Latin labor is akin to the root labi meaning to slip or slide backwards l37 though the commonly perceived meaning suggests difficulty and work
140Therefore anyone lost within must recognize that no one, not even a god or an Other, comprehends the entire maze and so therefore can never offer a definitive answer
Navidson's house seems a perfect example
Due to the wall-shifts and extraordinary size, any way out remains singular and app licable only to those on that path at that particular time
the cloathing is neither Woollen, nor linen, nor silk, sattin or velvet: it is drapery: it is nothing more
"145 Such global appraisal seems perfectly suited for Navidson's house which despite its corridors and rooms of various sizes is nothing more than corridors and rooms, even if sometimes, as John Updike once observed in the course of translating the labyrinth: "The gal
leries seem straight but curve furtively

"The growl almost always comes like the rustle of a high mountain wind on the trees," Navidson explained later
"You hear it first in the distance, a gentle rumble, slowly growing louder as it descends, until finally it's all around you, sweeping over you, and then past you, until it's gone, a mile away, two miles away, impossi

Beauregard again: "Co nsidering the cost of special effects these days, it is inconceivable how Navidson could have created his house

Strangely then, the best argument for fact is the absolute unaffordability of fiction
Thus it would appear the ghost haunting The Navidson Record, continua lly bashing against the door , is none other than the recurring threat of its own reality

Eventually Jed tries again to carry Wax toward what he hopes is home
He also attempts periodically to signal Navidson on the radio though never gets a response
Regrettably very little footage exists from this part of the voyage

Karenmay lose herself in resentment and fear, but the Navidson we see seems joyful, even euphoric, as he sets out with Reston and his brother to rescue Holloway and his team
It is almost as if entrance let alone a purpose-any purpose-in the face of those endless and lightless regions is reason enough to rejoice
153
Using 16mm motion picture (colour and B/W) and 35mm stills, Navidson for the first time begins to capture the size and sense of that place
Author Denise Lowery writes the following evocative impression of how Navidson photographs the Anteroom:

Since rescuing Holloway's team is the prime objective, Navidson
talces very few photographs
156
Eventually when they realize Holloway and his team are nowhere near the Great Hall, the plan becomes for Reston to set up camp at the top of the stairway while Navidson and Tom continue on below
Switching to Hi 8, we follow Navidson and Reston as they react to Tom's announcement

"Navy, I can't go down there," Tom stammers
"
Fortunately, by barely touching his friend's arm, Billy Reston forces Navidson to take a good hard look at his brother
As we can see for ourselves, he is pale, out of breath, and in spite of the cold, sweating profusely
Clearly in no condition to go any further let alone tackle the profound depths of that staircase
157 Navidson takes a deep breath
"Sorry Tom, I didn't mean to snap at
"
But Navidson has already started down the Spiral Staircase
"I should sue the bastard s who designed this house," Reston shouts after him
The dark minutes start to slide by
Based on Holloway's descent, Navidson had estimated the stairway was an incredible thirteen miles down
Less than five minutes later, however, Tom and Reston hear a shout
Tom immediately assumes they have stumbled upon the wrong set of stairs
Further investigation by Navidson , though, reveals the remnants of neon trail markers left by Holloway's team
159
Less than twenty minutes later he reaches the last step
Navidson knows he has no choice but to accept Reston's participa
tion, and heads back up to retrieve the wheelchair and the rest of their gear
Amazingly enough, Tom seems fine camping near the staircase
Both Navidson and Reston hope his presence will enable them to maintain radio contact for a much longer time than Holloway could
Even if they both know the house will still eventually devour their signal
161
As Navidson and Reston head out into the labyrinth, they occasionally come upon pieces of neon marker and shreds of various types of fishing line
Not even multi-strand steel line seems immune to the diminishing effects of that place
Not even multi-strand steel line seems immune to the diminishing effects of that place
"It looks like its impossible to leave a lasting trace here," Navidson observes
"The woman you never want to meet," quips Reston, always managing to keep his wheelchair a little ahead of Navidson

162
Soon, however, Reston begins to suffer from nausea, and even vomits
Navidson asks him ifhe is sick
Reston shakes his head
163
Navidson speculates Reston's sea sickness or his "mal de mer," as he calls it, may have something to do with the changing nature of the house : "Everything here is constantly shifting
It took Holloway, Jed, and Wax almost four days to reach the bottom of the staircase, and yet we made it down in five minutes
165
If one accepts Dahl's reading, then it follows that Holloway's creature comes from Holloway's mind not the house; the tiny room Wax finds himself trapped within reflects his own state of exhaustion and despair; and Navidson's rapid descent reflects his own knowledge that the Spiral Staircase is not bottomless
As Dr
When Holloway 's team traveled down the stairway, they had no idea if they would find a bottom
Navidson, however, knows the stairs are finite and therefore has far less anxiety about the descent

What is boredom
Endless repetitions, like, for example, Navidson's corridors and rooms, which are consistently devoid of any Myst-like discoveries ( see Chad; p

167
Unlike the real world, Navidson' s jour
ney into the house is not just figuratively but literally shortened
This theme of structures altered by perception is not uniquely
observed in The Navidson Record
Almost thirty years ago, Gunter
" Focusing on the constructions of any civilization, whether ancient or modem, it is hard to disagree with him
It is only when focusing on Navidson's house that these assertions begin to blur
171
171
Can Navidson 's house exist without the experience of itself
172
174
Even Michael Leonard, who had never heard of Navidson's house, professed a belief in the "psychological dimensions of space
" Leonard claimed people create a "sensation of space" where the final result "in the perceptual process is a single sensation-a 'feeling' about that particular place
177
Where Navidson ' s house is concerned, subjectivity seems more a matter of degree
The Infinite Corridor, the Anteroom, the Great Hall, and the Spiral Staircase, exist for all, though their respective size and even layout sometimes changes
181
Fortunately Reston's nausea does not last long, and he and Navidson can spend the rest of the day pushing deeper and deeper into the labyrinth
Initially, they follow the scant remains of the first team and then continue on by following their instincts
Initially, they follow the scant remains of the first team and then continue on by following their instincts
Based on the fact that there was very little evidence of the first team's descent remaining on the stairs, Navidson determines that the neon markers and fishing line last at most six days before they are entirely consumed by the house
182
Nevertheless, each agrees to alternately serve as watch
Navidson takes the first shift, spending his time removing the dark blotched gauze around his toes-clearly a painful process-before reapp lying ointment and a fresh dressing
Reston spends his time tinkering with his chair and the mount on the Arriflex
184
It is only as they are making camp for the second night that Navidson hears something
A voice, maybe a cry, but so fleeting were it not for Reston's confirmation, it probably would have been shrugged off as just a high note of the imagination
186
At one point, Navidson manages to get Tom on the radio, only to learn that there is something the matter with Karen
Unfortunately, the signal decays before he can get more details
187
Searching out more hallways, more turns, Navidson eventually
leads the way down a narrow conidor ending with a door
leads the way down a narrow conidor ending with a door
Navidson and
Reston open it only to discover another corridor ending with another door
fifty doors (it is impossible to calculate the exact number due to the jump
cuts), until Navidson discovers for the first and only time a door without a
door knob
189
As Navidson pulls away to re-examine the obstacle, he hears a whimper coming from the other side
Talcing two steps back, he throws his shoulder into the door
190
Reston keeps the chair mounted Arriflex trained on Navidson and while the focus is slightly soft, as the door breaks loose, the frame gracefully accepts Jed's ashen features as he faces what he has come to believe is his final moment
191
191
This whole sequence amounts to a pretty ratty collection of cuts alternating between Jed's Hi 8 and an equally poor view from the 16mm camera and Navidson and Reston's Hi 8s
Nevertheless what matters most here is adequate ly captured: the alchemy of social contact as Jed's rasp of terror almost instantly transforms itself into laughter and sobs of relief
205
Ken Bums has used this particular moment to illustrate why The Navidson Record is so beyond Hollywood: "Not only is it gritty and dirty and raw, but look how the zoom claws after the fleeting fact
Watch how the frame does not, cannot anticipate the action
