Thus if something should happen, causing them to lose their hold on the rope, the stretcher would still stop short of hitting the bottom by several feet

Navidson double-checks to make sure the end of the rope is still secure ly tied to the last banister and then begins hoisting his friend up the shaft
"You are one heavy bastard," Navidson grunts

At first everything seems to be proceeding smoothly
Slowly but surely, Navidson draws more and more slack rope down onto the floor, steadily lifting Reston up through the bore of those stairs
Then about half way up, something strange happens: the excess rope at Navidson's feet starts to vanish while the rope he holds begins to slip across his fingers and palms with enough speed to leave a burning gash

By the time Reston reaches the top the rope has gone taut, but the stairway still continues to stretch
Realizing what is about to happen, Navidson makes a desperate grab for the only remaining thread connecting him to home, but he is too late
About ten feet above the last banister
For example, on my way back from the Shop, something strange surfaced
I say "strange" because it doesn't seem connected to anything-nothing my boss said or Navidson did or anything else immediately on my mind
I was just driving towards my place and all of a sudden I realized I was wrong
301
Above him, Navidson hears a faint cry and then nothing
Not even the tiniest hole of light
303
For the final shot of this section, Navidson loads his Arriflex with a 100ft of high-speed tungsten , uses a five minute ultra high intensity lightstick to illuminate the area, and rolls his Hi 8 to record sound

And yet even these violent fantasies were nothing compared to what lay in wait at the centre of the drawing
The week before Navidson set out on the rescue attempt, Brookes had asked her third grade class to draw a picture of their house

Karen keeps by the radios
Dr
Lon Lew believes the house enabled Karen to slowly break down her reliance on Navidson, allowing her a greater and more permanent distance : "Her children's fear coupled with their need for her further separated Karen from Navidson
Sadly, it's not the healthiest way to proceed

She recognizes that the key to her mis
ery lies in the still unexplored fissure between herself and Navidson
Without knowing it she has already begun her slow turn to face the meaning, or at least one meaning, of the darkness dwelling in the depths of her house
Helen Agallway asserts that by "Monday, October 8th, Karen has made up her mind to depart
When Tom reappears in the living room and informs her that Navidson is only hours away from getting back, she keeps the children home from school because she has every intention of leaving for New York that day
"264
That said, it is crucial to recognize how poor quality and general incoherence is not a reflection of the creator's state of mind
Quite the contrary, Navidson brilliantly used these stylistic discrepancies to further drive home the overwhelming horror and dislocation experienced by his family during "The Evacuation

Tom continues to sit with Karen, until eventually her muted cries join the wail of sirens rapidly approaching their house on Ash Tree Lane

One clip captures the Sheriff in the process of climbing into his squad car: "For once and for all, that house was completely searched and Holloway Roberts was not in it
When Tom had returned from the grave, he was convinced he had lost his brother
Both he and Reston had heard the great Spiral Staircase yawn beneath them, and Reston's Hi 8 had even caught a glimpse of Navidson 's light sinking, finally vanishing into the deep like a failing star
As Billy explains in The Reston Interview: "Tom felt like a part of him had been ripped away

tells the "grave-maker" joke, while Reston, during the rescue attempt, admits to Navidson: "You know, I

" "Well
Karen returns to her room when she sees Tom and Reston reappear only five minutes later
Even though he too is suffering from Navidson's disappearance, Reston still does his best to counsel Tom, and at least for a few hours Tom successfully resists drinking anything more
Chad apparently had escaped from the house at dawn and now refuses to come in or say a word to his mother
On the third and fourth day, Tom does not emerge once from the study, attempting to drink his grief into submission
Karen, on the other hand, begins to deal with the consequences of Navidson's disappearance
She rapidly starts paying more attention to her children, finally luring Chad back into the house where she can oversee his (and Daisy's) packing efforts
In a brief clip we catch Karen on the phone, presumably with her mother, discussing their imminent departure from Virginia
Reston remains in the living room, frequently attempting to raise Navidson on the radio, though never hearing more than static and white noise
Outside a thunder storm begins to crack and spit rain at the windows

off-no longer ordered to run by the motion detectors-Navidson limps out
of the hallway
immediately kneels beside her, attempting to wake her with the gentlest word
Karen, however, drawn so abruptly from her dreams, cannot arrest the shocked gasp summoned by the sound and sight of Navidson
Of course, the moment she realizes he is not a ghost, her terror dissolves into a hug and a flood of words, awakening everyone in the house
Consider Anita Massine 's comments:
Her initial embrace and happines s is not just about Navidson's return
Karen realizes she has fulfilled her end of the bargain
Her time in that place has come to an end
Navidson's arrival means she can leave
272
Or finally Professor Lyle Macdonough:
The reason Karen cries out when Navidson wakes her has nothing to do with the inherent terror of that hallway or some other cauche

mar
It has only to do with Navidson
Deep down inside, she really does fear him

Karen clearly refuses to allow Navidson's appearance to alter her plans
She does not accept that merely his presence entitles him to authority

Unlike Navidson, Karen does not need to watch the tape twice
She immediately starts dragging suitcases and boxes out into the rain
Reston helps
Navidson does not argue but recognizes that their departure is going to take more than a couple of minutes
"Go to a motel if you want," he tells Karen

RouJet also states in his preface: "My friend Diana Neetz at The World of Interiors likes to imagine that the stage is set for Lear, especially with that October storm continuing to boom outside the Navidson's home

Only when they have disappeared upstairs does Tom lift up the basinet and pull out a bottle of bourbon
A few minutes later, Navidson enters the living room carrying a load of video tape and film
In all the commotion following his return, he has not yet had a spare moment to spend with his brother
That all changes, however, when he finds Tom on the floor, his head propped up against the couch, enjoying his drink
"Knock it off," Navidson says swiftly, grabbing the alcohol from his brother
"Now is not the time to go on a binge
"
Setting down the box he is carrying, Navidson helps his twin up
"Here, let me make you some coffee
Tom gives a noticeable sigh as he at last leans on his brother
Not till now has he been able to really face the crippling grief Navidson's absence had caused him or for that matter address the enormous relief he now feels knowing his twin did indeed survive
We watch as tears well in his eyes
We watch as tears well in his eyes
Navidson puts his ann around him: "Come on

"It 's always there for you," Navidson answers, his own cheeks suddenly flushing with emotion as he helps his weaving brother to the kitchen
"That's right," Tom whispers
Followed by another one
Navidson is outside loading a box of Hi 8 cassettes into the car when he sees the upstairs lights in the house go out one by one
A second later Karen screams
