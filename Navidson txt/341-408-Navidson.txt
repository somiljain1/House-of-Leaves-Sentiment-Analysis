325 326 One of  the  most  excruciating and  impudent works on the subject was wri t en by Jeremy Flint. Regrettably this reprehensible concoction of speculation, fantasy, and repellent prose, also incl[ ]es or refers to primary documents not avai lable anywhere  else.  Through  hard work,  luck, or  theft, Flint managed to [ ] across some of the notes and summations made by psychiatrist Nancy Tobe who for a br[ ]f period treated Holloway for [] depression:277 Page one of Dr. Tobe's notes contains only two words, capitalized, written in pencil, dead center on a page tom from a legal pad:CONSIDERING SUICIDE.[ ]he next two pages are for the most part illegible, with words such as "family" "father"" loyalty" "the old home" appearing every now and then in an otherwise dark scribble of ink.However,	Tobe's	typed	summation following the first session offers a few []details concerning Holloway's life: "Despite his own achievement [sic] which range from Scuba Diving expeditions in the G[]Aqaba,	leading	climbers	up	the Matterhorn, organizing numerous [] as wellas expeditions to the North and South Pole, Holloway feels inadequate and suffers from acute and chronic depression. Unable to see how much he has already accomplished, he constantly dwells on suicide. I am considering several anti-depressants []	and	have	recommended	daily counseling. "278Flint goes on to cover the second visit which [ ] much repeats his observations concerning the first. The third visit, however, gives up the first th[]m.In another series of notes Tobe describes Holloway's first love: "At seventeen, he met a young woman named Eliz[]beth who he de- scribed to me as 'Beautiful like a doe. Dark eyes. Brown hair. Pretty ankles, kinda skinny and weak.' A short courtship ensued and for a brief time they were a couple.[ ]In Holloway's XXXXXXX279, the relation- ship ended because he didn't [sic] the Varsity football squad. By his own admission he was never any good at 'team sports.' Her interest in him faded and she soon beg[ ] dating the starting tackle, leaving Holloway broken hearted with an increased sen[ ]e of [illegible] and inadequacy."280278Jeremy Flint's Violent Seeds: The Holloway Roberts Myst [ ]y (Los[]Angel[ ]: 2.13.61, 1996), p. 48. 279These Xs indicate text was inked out-not burned.280FJint, p. 53. Nancy Tobe was a fairly green therapist and took far too many notes. Perhaps she felt that by studying these pages later, she could synthesize the material and present her patient with a solution. She had not yet real[ ] that her notes or her solutions would mean absolutely no[ ]g. Patients must discover their peace for themselves. Tobe [	] only a guide. The solution is personal. It is ironic then that had it not been for Tobe's inexperience, the notes so intrinsic to achieving at least a fair understanding of Holloway's inner torment would never have come into existence. Peoplealways demand experts, though sometimes they are fortunate enough to find a beginner.281On the fourth visit, Tobe [	] transcribed Holloway's words verbatim. It is i[]possible to tell from Flint's text whether Tobe actually record[]d Hollow[ ] or just wrote down his words from memory:"I had already been out there for two days and then that morning, before dawn, I [] to the ridge and waited. I waited a long time and I didn't move. It was cold. Real cold. Up till then everyone had been talking about the big buck but no one had seen anything. Not even a rabbit. Even though I'd been deer hunting a few times, I'd never actually  shot  a dee r, but  with,  well  the football team [    ], Elizabeth gone like that, I was gonna set it right by dropping that mg buck."When	the sun finally came out, Icouldn't believe my eyes. There he was, right across the valley, the [ ] buck tasting the air.[ ) I was a good shot. I knew what to do and I did it. I took my time, centered the reti- cule, let out my breath, squeezed slowly, and listened to that round as it cracked across the valley. I must have closed my eyes 'cause the next thing I saw the deer [	] to the ground."Everyone heard my shot and [] Funny thing was, because of where I'd been, I was the last one to get there. My dad was waiting for me, just shaking his head, angry, and shamed."'Look what you done boy,' he said in a whisper but I could have heard that whisper across the whole valley. "Look what you done. [ ] shot yourself a doe." [] I almost killed myself then but I guess I thought it couldn't get any worse. [	] that was the worst. Staring at that dead doe and then watching my dad turn his back on me and just walk away."282281Refer back to Chapter 5: footnote 67. - Ed.282F lint, p. 6 I.329 At this point Flint's analysis heads into a fairly pejorative and unoriginal analysis of vi[]lence. He also makes a little t[ ] much of the word "doe" which Holloway used to describe his first love E[ ]zabeth. However since Flint is not the only one to make this association, it is worth at least a cursory gl[ ]nee."A vengeance transposed on the wild," Flint calls Holloway'skilling of the doe, implying that to Holloway's eye the doe had become Elizabeth. What  Flint,  however,  fails  to  acknowledge  is  that  with  no certainty can he detennine whether  Hollow[]y  described  Elizabeth  as  a "doe" while he was going out with her []r afterward. Holloway may have described her as such following the ill-fated  hunting  trip  as  a  means  to comp[ ]nd his guilt, thus blaming himself not only for the  death  of the doe but for the death of love as well.  In [	] Flint's suggestion of brimming violence may be nothing more than a gross renaming of self[]reproach.Flint [	] argue that Holloway's aggressive nature was boundto su[]face in what he calls Navidson's []Hall of Amplification."Holloway's latent suicidal urges [	] when Wax and Jed insist on turning back. He sees this (incorrectly) as an admission of fail- ure,  another  failure,  th[]s  incr[  ]sing  his sense of inadequacy.Holloway had over the years developed enough psychic defense mechanisms to avoid the destructive consequences of this self- determine[	]f defeat.What made this incident different from all the rest was the []ou[]e.In many ways, Navidson's house func- tions like  an immense isolation tank. Deprived of light, change in temperature and any sense of time, the individual begins to create his own sensory [	], [ ]d depen[]ng on the duration of his stay begins to pro- ject more and more of [	]  personality on those bare walls and vacant []allways.In Holloway's case, the house as well as everything inside it becomes an exten[ ]n of himself, e.g. Jed and Wax become the psy[]logical demons responsible for his failue [sic]. Thus  his  first  act-to sh[  ]t  Wax-is in fact the beginning of a nearly operatic s[]i[ ]de.2s3Certainly Flint [ ] not alone in emphasiz[ ]g the impl[ ]t violence i[]suicide.  In  1910 at [] conference in Vienna, Wilhelm Stekel cla[]med  [  ]  "no one killed himself unless he[]either wanted to kill another person []r 283IbXXXXXXXXSuiXXXXXXXXXXX [284rnked out as well as burned. ) XXXX:XXXX284330 wished a[]other's death"285 [	]1983 Buie and Maltzberger described s[ ]cide [ ]resulting from "two types of imperative impulses: murder[]us hate and an ur[]ent need to es[Jape suff[Jring."286Robert Jean Cam[ ]ell sums up t[]e psych[]dynamics of suic[ ]s as fol[ ]ws:... sui[ ] or a suicide atte[ Jt is seen most freque[ ]ly to be an agg[ ]sive attack directed against a loved one or against society  in ge[  Jal; in others, it  may be a mis[  ]ded bid for attention or may be conceived of as a means of ef[ ]ting reunion with the id[]al love-object or m[]ther. That suicide [ ]n one sense a means of relea[]e for aggressive im- pulses is sup[ ]ed by the change of wartime suicide rates. In Wo[ J War II, for example, rates among the participating nations Jell, []times by as  much  as  30%;  but in ne[	]lcountries, the rates remained the same.In involutional depressions and in the depr[ Jed type of manic[]depressive psycho- sis, the following dynamic elements are of[]n clearly operative: the d[ Jessed patient loses the object that he depends upon for nar- cissistic s[ ]lies; in an atte[ ]t to force the object's return, he regre[ ]es to the oral stage and inc[ ]porates (swallows up) the object, t[]us regressively identi[ ]ing with the object: the sadism originally directed against the de- sert[ ] object is ta[]en up by the patient's sup[ ]go and is directed against the incorpo- rated object,  w[  ]h  now  lodges  wit[ Jn the ego; suicide oc[ ]s, not so much as  an  at- tempt on the ego's part to esc[]pe the inexorable demands of the superego, but rather as a[ ]enraged attack on the in[]orated object in retaliation []or its having dese[ ]d the pati[ ] in the first place.287[It[ Js added f[]r em[ Jasis]Of course the anni[Jil[Jtion of [ ]self does not necessarily preclude the anni[ ]n of others. As is evident in sh[ ]ting sprees that culminate in suicide, an attack on the[ ]incorporated object" may extend first to [ ]attack on loved ones, co-work[ ] or even innocent by[ ]ders-a description, which ev[] Flint would agree, fits H[]lloway.Nevertheless th[]re are also numer[ ]s objections to Flint[]s asser[] that Hollow[ ]'s suicidal disposition would within that place inevitabl[] lead to murder. The most enlight[	]g refutation comes from Rosemary285Ned H. Cassem, "The Person C[]nfronting Death" in The Ne [ ]Harvard Guide to Psychiatry ed. Armand M.

It sat on his shoulder more often than not: "It's there before I sleep, there when I wak e, it's there a lot. But as Nietzsche said, 'The t[]ought of suicide is a consolation. It can get one through many a bad night.'" (See Dr. Hetterman Stone's Confidential: An In[]view With  Karen Green  19[	]Navidson often viewed his achievements with disdain, considered his direction vague, and frequently assumed his desires would []ever be met by life []o matter how f[ ]ly he lived it. However, unlike H[ ]loway, he converted his d[ ]pair into art. He [ ]lied on his eye and ftlm to bring meaning to virt[ ] everything he e[]count[ Jed, and though he paid the high price of lost interaction, he fre- quently conceived beautiful instances worthy of our time; what Robert Hughes famously referred to [ ] "Navidson 's little windows of light."Flint would [	]test [ ] while both Holloway and [ ]vidson camped in the same dale of depression, they were very dif[]rent in[ ]viduals: Navidson was merely a photographer while, to quote F[ ]nt "Hollo- way was a hunter who [ ] crossed the line into territories of aggress[]on."Flint sh[ ]Id have done his []omework, if he thought Navidson never crossed that line.In the 70's Navidson became  a career p[ ]journ[]list and ultimately a famous one but at the begin[]ing of that de[]ade he wasn't carrying a Nikon. He was manning an M-60 with the 1st cav[ ]y at Rock Island East where he would eventually receive a Bronze332 Star for saving the  l[]ves of two [	] soldiers he dra0ged from a burning person- nel carrier. He[	]ver, no longer has the medal. He sent it along with a [ ]oto of h[]s first kill to Richard Nixon  to  pr[]test  the war.288Unfortun[ ]ely when Navi[]son stumbled  upon  Hol[  ]'s  H[  ]8 tapes, he had no idea their contents would [ ]spire such a heated and lasting debate over what l[Jrked in  the  [ ]art of that p[]ace. Despite the radically differ0nt behavior pattern[] demonst[]ated by the hunter from Me[ ]mo[ ], Wi[  ]sin  and  the  Pulitzer Prize-winning  photojournalist[ ]in  the  house, The Hollow[ ] Tape revealed that e[]ther one could just as easily have been devo[]r[]d in the same way. The gli[ ]se rescued from that t[ Jr[ ]b[]le []ark warned that while paths might differ, the end might no[].9.The Hol(	]y Tape"I'm lost. Out of food. Low on water. No  sense  of direction.  Oh god ... [	]So be[]ins The Holloway Tape- Holloway leering into  the  camera, a backdrop of wall, final moments in a man's life. These are jarring pieces, coherent only in the way they trace a de[]line.Ove[]view:¥	The opening card displays a quote from Gaston Bachelard's The Poetics of Space: "The dreamer in his comer wrote off the world in   a detailed daydream that destroyed,  one  by  one,  all  the  objects  in  the world."289¥	There  are thirteen parts.	[	]¥	They are separated by  3-seconds  of white  frame.  In the  upper ri[Jht hand comer a number or word tracks the chronology, starting with "First," continuing with" 2" thr[] "12" and ending with "Last." The type- face is the same Janson as issued by Anton Janson in Leipzig between 1660 and 1687.¥	These insertions  were  designed  by Navidson. They[	], and in no way alter the original segments.Navidson reproduces Holloway's tape in its entirety.Who can forget Holloway's grizzled features as he []urns the camera on hi[]self?No comfort now. No hope of rescue or return."I deserve this. I brought this all on me. But I'm s[] sorry. I'm so[]rry," he says in Part 2. "But what does that matter?  I shot  them.  I shot both of [ ]em.

And with that last utterance, Holloway's eyes reveal who here is real[]y lost.Despite Holloway's undeniable guilt, not since Floyd Collins became trapped in the Kentucky Sand Cave back in 1925 has there been such a terrible instance of suffering. Co[]lins remained alive for fourteen days and nights before he died. Despite the efforts of many men to free him from the squeeze, Collins never saw the light of day again. He only felt the ink[    ]darkness and cold [	] in on him, bind him, kill him. All hecould do was rave about angels in chariots and liver and onions and chicken sandwiches.290Unlike Floyd Collins, no straight jacket of mud and rock holds Holloway. He can still move around, though where he moves leads nowhere. By the time he begins to video tape his final hours, he has []ready recognized the complete hopelessness of the situation. Repeatin[]his identity seems the only mantra [ ]offers any consolation: "Holloway Roberts. Born in M[ ]om[	]sin. Bachelor's from U. Mass. "29 1 It is almost as if he believes preserving his identity on video tape can somehow hold what he is powerless to prevent: those endless contours of dark[]ess stealing the Hollow[ ] from himself. "I'm Holloway Roberts." he insists. "Born in Menomonie, Wi[ ]n. Bachelor's from U. Mass. Explorer, professional hunter,[		Jeth. [Long pause] This is not right. It's not fair. I don't [ ]serve to die."Regrettably, the limited amount of light, the [	]uality of tape, not to mention the constant oscillation between sharp and blurry (compliments of the Hi 8's automatic focus)[] barely c[ Jure Holloway's bearded face let [ ]one anything else-not to imply that there exists an'else'. Mainly a backdrop of darkness, which, as the police observed, could have [ ]en shot in any lightless room or closet.  [	]In other words, the immen[]ity of Navidson's house eludes the frame. It exists only in Holloway's face, fear etc[ ] deeper and deeper into his features, the cost of dying paid out with p[]un[]s of flesh and e[]ch s[]allow breath. It is painful[ ] obvious the creature Holloway hunts has already begun to feed on him. 291Jntheepil0gueoflier bo[]k Fear Mantras JO.(Cambridge: Harvard Un[	]ress, 1995) AUcia Hoyle disc[ ]ses Hollow[Jy's l(]ck of fear training: "He didn[]t even pos[]es[] the ancient Hak-Kin-Dak man[]ra" (p.

Part 3, however, is different. It only lasts four seconds.  With  eyes wide open, voice hoarse, lips split and bleeding, Hol[ ]y barks  "I'm  not alone." Part 5 fo[]lows up with, "There's something here. I'm sure of  it now." Part 8 with: "It's following me. No, it's stalking  me."  And  Part  9: "But it won't strike. It's just out there waiting.

Tomaddressed his [ ]agon with sarcasm, referring to i[] as "Mr. Monster" while describing himself as unpalatable. Humor proved a p[]werful psychological sh[]e[]d. Holloway has his rifle but it proves the weaker  of the  two.  Cold metal and gunpowder offer him ver[] little internal calm.

Pitch a[]d Kadina Ashbeckie stand on  opposite ends of the spectrum, one favoring an actual monster, the other opting for a ratio[]al explan[]tion. Neither one, however,  succeeds in [	] a definitive interpretation.Last spring, Pitch in the Pelias Lecture Ser[]es announced:  "0 f  course there's a beast! And I assure you our belief or disbelief makes very little difference to that thing!"293 In American Photo (May 1996, p.  154) Kadina Ashbeckie wr[]te: "Death of light gives birth to a creature-darkness few can accept as pure[]absence. Thus despite rational object[]ons, technology's failure is over[]un by the onslaught of myth."294[]Except the Vandal known as Myth always slaughters Reason if she falters.

Joe   Willis (Film Comment, [	] p. 115) has pointed out that Barnholt's complaint  concerns  those prints  released  after  199[].  Apparently  Part  I2 in  all  prints  before  [  J and  after  I993  show   a view  consistent with the other twelve. And yet even  though  the spectre of digital manipulation has been raised in The Navidson Record, to thfa day no adequate explanation has managed to resolve the curious enigma concerning Part 12.293Aiso see Incarnation Of Spirit Things and Lo[ J by Lantern C.

Suffice it to  say,  Holloway  does not [	]French for his end.

Sheimmediately starts dragging suitcases and boxes out into the  rain.  Reston helps. Navidson does not argue but recognizes that  their  departure  is  going to take more than a couple of minutes."Go to a motel if you want," he tells Karen. "I've still got to pack up aIJ the video and film."At first Karen insists on remaining outside in the car with the children, but eventually the lure of lights, music, and the murmur of familiar voices proves too much, especially when faced with the continuing thunderstorm howling in the absence of dawn.Inside she discovers Tom has attempted to provide some measure of security. Not only has he bolted the four locks on the hallway door, he has gleefully established a rebarbative barricade out of a bureau, china cabinet, and a couple of chairs, crowning his work with the basinet from the foyer.Whether a coincidence or not, Cassady Roulet has gone to greatlengths to illustrate how Tom's creation resembles a theatre:Note how the china cabinet serves as a backdrop, the opposing chairs as wings, the bureau, of course, providing the stage, while the  basinet  is  none  other than the set, a complicated symbol suggesting the ac- tion of the approaching play. Clearly the subject concerns war or at the very least characters who have some military history. Furthermore the basinet in the context of the approaching performance has been radically altered from its previous meaning as bastion or strong hold or safe. Now it no longer feigns any authority over the dark beyond. It inherently  abdi- cates all pretense of significance. 305Karen appreciates Tom's work on this last line of defense, but she is most touched by the way he comicaIJy clicks his heals and presents her with the]endlessly[] in an ever unfolding []nd yet never opening sequence,  ] lost on stone trails [ 305cassady Roulet's Theater In Film (Burlington: Barstow Press, 1994), p. 56.

An attempt to offer Karen some measure of control, or at least sense of control, over the horror beyond the door.It is impossible to interpret her thanks as anything but heartfelt. Tomoffers a clownish salute, winning a smile from both Chad and Daisy who are still somewhat disoriented from  having  been  awakened  at  five  in  the morning and dragged out into the storm. Only when they have disappeared upstairs does Tom lift up the basinet and pull out a bottle of bourbon.A few minutes later, Navidson enters the living room carrying  a load of video tape and film. In all the commotion following  his  return,  he  has  not yet had a spare moment to spend  with  his  brother.  That  all  changes, however, when he finds Tom on the floor, his head propped up against the couch, enjoying his drink."Knock it off," Navidson says swiftly, grabbing the alcohol fromhis brother. "Now is not the time to go on a binge." "I'm not drunk." "Tom, you're lying on the floor." his head: "Navy, Tom takes a quick glance at himself, then shakes you know what Dean Martin said?""Sure. You're not drunk if you can lie down without holding on." "Well look," Tom mutters, lifting his arms in the air. "No hands." Setting down the box he is carrying, Navidson helps his twin  up. "Here, let me make you some coffee."Tom gives a noticeable sigh as he at last leans on his brother. Not till now has he been able to really face the crippling  grief Navidson's  absence had caused him or for that matter address the enormous relief he now feels knowing his twin did indeed survive. We watch as tears well in his eyes.Navidson puts his ann around him: "Come on.""At least when you're drunk," Tom adds, quickly wiping the wet from his face. "You've always got the floor for your best friend. Know why?" "It's always there for you," Navidson answers, his own cheeks suddenly flushing with emotion as he helps his weaving brother to thekitchen."That's right," Tom whispers. "Just like you."Reston is the one who  hears  it  first.  He  is  alone  in  the  living  room up all the radios, when from behind the hallway door comes a faint grinding. It sounds miles away, though still powerful enough to cause  the basinet on the bureau to tremble. Slowly the noise gathers itself, growing louder and louder, getting closer and closer, something unheralded and unfamiliar contained in its gain, evolving into a  new  and  already misconstrued sort of menace. Reston's hands  instinctively  grab the  wheels of his chair,  perhaps  expecting  this  new  evolution  within  the chambers  of the house to shatter the hallway door. Instead it just dies, momentarilyrelinquishing its threat to silence.Reston exhales.And then from behind the door comes a knock. Followed by anotherone.Navidson  is  outside  loading  a box   of  Hi   8  cassettes   into  the  carwhen he sees the upstairs lights in the house go  out  one  by  one.  A second later  Karen   screams.   The  pelting   rain  and   occasional   crack  of  thunder340 muffles the sound, but  Navidson instinctively recognizes the notes of her distress. As Billy described the scene in The Reston Interview:Navidson's dehydrated, hasn't eaten shit for two days, and now  he's  dragging  supplies out to the car in the middle of a thunderstorm. Every step he talces hurts. He's dead on  his feet, in total survival mode,  and  all  it  talces  is her voice. He drops everything.  Lost  some rolls of film to water damage too. Just tears through the house to get her.Due to the  absence of any exterior cameras,  all  experiences  outside  the house rely on personal accounts. Inside, however, the wal l mounted  Hi 8s continue to function.Karen is upstairs placing her  hair  brushes,  perfume,  and  jewelry box in a bag, when the bedroom begins  to  collapse.  We watch  the  ceiling tum  from  white to ash-black  and  drop.  Then  the  walls  close  in  with enoughforce  to splinter the dresser,  snap  the  frame  of the  bed,  and  hurl  lamps from their nightstands, bulbs popping, light executed.Right before the bed is sheared in half, Karen succeeds in scram- bling into the  strange closet space intervening between parent and child. Conceptual artist Martin Quoirez observes that this is the first time the house has "physically acted" upon inhabitants and objects:Initially, distance, dark,  and  cold  were  the only modes of violence. Now suddenly, the house offers a new one. It is impossible to conclude that Holloway's actions altered the physics of that space. Nevertheless, it is im- possible to deny that its nature seems to have changed.306Karen avoids the threat in her bedroom only  to  find  herself  in  a space rapidly enlarging,  the  size swallowing up  all  light as  well  as  Daisy's barelyaudible cries for help. almost  immediately  crushes  Karen.  She  collapses. Of The darknesscourse, there are no cameras at this point to show her lost in seizure. That history relies once again on The Reston Interview:Navy said it felt like he was running into the jaws of some big beast about to chomp down... and as you saw later on, that's- that's exactly what that ugly fucker finally did.[Reston chokes back tears]still Sorry . . .

Back through their bedroom. Barely makes it through. The door frame came down like a guillotine. Hammered Navy's shoulder  and  grazed Karen in the head with enough force she lost consciousness.I telJ you Navy's one tough fucker.  He kept going, down the stairs, and finally out- side. And then Daisy stopped screaming. 11. The next clip of Hi 8 shows Navidson  reentering  the  house,  shout- ing for Daisy and Chad as he sprints  down  the  hall,  heading  toward  the  stairs in order to get back up to the children's bedroom. Then suddenly the floor drops away and he is sliding straight into the living room where he would have died had he not  succeeded  with  one desperate  flail  to grab hold of the handle to one of the doors.The Reston Interview:Me, I had been trying to get the hell out  of there. The knock had turned into this heavy awful pounding. The hallway door was still bolted shut and barricaded but I just knew all hell was about to break lose.In fact, my first thought was that it wasHolloway, though that hammering was awful hard. I mean the whole wall shuddered with every hit, and I'm thinking if that  is  Hollo- way he's changed and I don't need to reacquaint myself with this new and im- proved version. Especially not now.[Reston repositions his  wheelchair slightly]My chair was still pretty messed up so I couldn't move as fast as I normally do.  Then all of a sudden, the pounding stops. Just like that. Silence.  No  banging,  no  growl,  noth- ing. And boy,  I don't  know  how  to  describe it but that silence was more powerful than any sound, any call. I had to answer it, that silence, I mean , I had to respond. I had  to look.So I turn around-you can see some  of this on the video-the door's still closed  and the stuff Tom put together is still in front, though the-what-you-call-it, the helmet, has already fallen to the floor. Then the china cabinet and bureau start  to  sink. Slowly at first, inch by inch, and then a little faster. My342 chair begins to slide. I wedge the brakes, grip the wheels. At first I don't understand what's happening until it dawns on me that it's  the floor beneath the barricade that's dropping.That's when I twisted around and lunged for the foyer.  No chance I could have wheeled out of there. I  barely  managed  to reach the door frame and  get enough of a purchase to hang  on. My  chair  though slipped out from under me  and just rolled, end over end, down that slope.The floor must have sunk six, seven feet. Way below the baseboard, like the founda- tion had given way, except there was  no fucking foundation. You expected to see ce- ment but all there was was blackness.All of it- the china cabinet, bureau,  cof- fee table, chairs-just  slid  down  that  floor and vanished over the edge. Navy would have vanished too if he hadn't got hold  of that door lever.Thus the devouring of one theatre of the absurd leads  to  another.  And  as  is  true in both cases, no amount of monologue, costume, or wit can defer the insistent gravity of that void. As theatre critic Tony K. Rich once remarked: "The only option is a quick exit, stage left, and I'd also advise a cab to the airport."307 The exit, however, is not so easily achieved. The Reston Interview again: Well I started yelling for  help.  You  have to remember, my hands were all messed up from my trip down there. My grip  was  fail- ing. If Navy didn't get to  me   fast,  I  was going to fall.So Navy starts swinging that door he's hanging on, back and forth, until he  can  kind of swing, kind of scramble to where he's about three fee t away from me. Then he takes this deep breath, gives me half a smile, and jumps.That was the longest moment of them all, and then it was over.  He  was  holding onto the door  frame,  hauling  himself  into the foyer, and then  dragging  me  to  safety. And all that with a messed up shoulder too.On tape, it looks like Navy just  hopped over to  me  and  that  was  that.  But  boy  the way I remember it, his jump took forever.Though poorly lit with even poorer resolution, we can see in the video how Navidson  uses  the door  to  get  in range of Reston,  despite  the fact that the hinges are about to give way. Luckily, he manages to jump free307Tony K. Rich's "Tip The Porter" The Washington Post, v. 119, December 28, 1995, p. C-1, column 4.343 just as the door wrenches loose and tumbles into oblivion. The whole thing does not last more than a handful of seconds, but like Reston, Navidson notes how this brief bit of action still leaves a lasting impression. From The Last Interview:A few moments ended  up feeling like hours. I was just dangling on that brass han- dle, not daring to look, though of course I did. The floor was steeper than the Lhotse Face, dropping right off into that familiar chill. I knew I had to get  to Billy. I just hadn't figured out how yet. Then I heard the ripping. The hinges weren't supporting my weight.So I did about the only thing I could think of: I swung the door left, right, then left, and right one more time which closed the gap to a few feet from where Reston was hanging. Just as I made my jump, I heard the first hinge and then the second hinge tear free of the frame. That sound stretched the seconds into hours.[Pause]Once I made it though, everything sped up again. The next thing I knew we were both out on the front lawn getting soaked by the rain.You know when I finally went back to the house to retrieve the Hi 8s, I couldn't be- lieve how quickly it had all happened. My leap looks so easy and that darkness doesn't seem dark at all. You can't see the hollow- ness in it, the cold. Funny how incompetent images can sometimes be.Those last words in particular may sound a bit glib, especially coming from such an esteemed photographer. Nevertheless, in spite of numerous Hi 8s mounted all over the house, Navidson is right: all the images recorded during this segment are inadequate.Too bad Navidson never holds a camera The entire sequence covering the escape from the house is reminiscent of something taken off of a cheap surveillance system in a local bank or ?-Eleven. The clips are impartial renderings of a space. If the action slips past the frame, the camera does not care enough to adjust its perspective. It cannot see what matters. It cannot follow.Only the interviews inform these events. They alone show us howthe moments bruise and bleed. I2. Outside rain overwhelms everything, drenching the street, filling the gutters, stripping trees of fall leaves. Reston sits on the grass, soaked to the bone but refusing to take shelter. Karen is still unconscious, lying in the car exactly where Navidson put her.Daisy and Chad, however, are still missing.344 So for that matter is Tom.Navidson is trying to decide how he  should  reenter  the  house  when the sound of shattering glass draws him to the backyard. "It was definitely a window breaking" Reston remembers.  "And  when  Navy  heard  it,  he  just took off running."Reston recalls watching  Navidson  disappear  around  the house.  He had no idea what would  happen  next.  It  was  bad  enough  that  he  was without his wheelchair. Then he heard Daisy scream, a high-pitched  burst bright enough to  pierce  the hard patter  of  the storm, followed by shouts, and then  something Reston  had  never heard  before: "It was  like  an immense gasp, only very, very loud."Reston was squinting in the rain, when he suddenly saw a shadow separate from the tree line: "By then dawn had  begun  to  creep  in  but  the storm clouds were still keeping the day pretty  dark." Reston immediately assumed it was Navidson  but  then  as  the figure  got  closer  he  could  see  it was much smaller than  his friend. "A strange walk too. Not  fast  at  all  but very deliberate. There was even something threatening about it."Chad just nodded at  Reston  as  he  passed  by  him  and  climbed into the car. He never said a thing either, just sat down next to his mother and waited for her to wake up.Chad had seen what had happened but had no words to describe it.Reston knew if he   wanted  to  find  out,  he  would  have  to  drag  himself toward the back of the house, which is exactly what he started to do.Daisy had stopped screaming because of Tom.Somehow Tom had managed to make his way through the heaving house to the upstairs hallway where he began to close in on the cries of the terrified five year old. What no one knew then  was that Chad  had  already snuck outside, preferring the solitude of the early morning to all  the  packing and panic curdling inside.As we can see, Tom finally finds Daisy frozen in the shadows. Without a word, he sweeps her up in his  arms  and  races  back  down  to  the first floor, avoiding the precipitous drop into the living room-the way Navidson had gone-by dashing instead toward the rear of the house.The whole place keeps shuddering  and  shaking,  walls  cracking  only to melt back together again, floors fragmenting and buckling, the ceiling suddenly  rent  by  invisible  claws,  causing  moldings  to  splinter,  water pipes to rupture, electrical wires to spit and short out. Worse, the  black  ash of below, spreads like printer's ink over everything, transforming each comer, closet, and corridor into that  awful  dark.  Then  Tom  and  Daisy's  breath begins to frost.In the kitchen, Tom  throws  a stool  through  the  window.  We  hear Tom saying: "Okay Daisy girl.make it through here and you 're home free." Which might have been just that simple had the floor not taken on the characteristics of giant conveyor belt,  suddenly  drawing  them away from their only escape.Cradling Daisy in his arms, Tom starts running as fast  as  he  can, trying to out race the shock of the void yawning up behind them. Ahead, Navidson appears in the window.Tom pushes harder, edging closer and closer, until finally as he gets within reach, he holds Daisy out to Navidson who despite the  fragments  of glass scratching long bloody lines along  his  forearms,  immediately  rips  her free of the house and into safety.345 Tom, however, has found his limit. Badly out of breath, he stops running and drops to his knees, clutching his sides and heaving for air.  The floor carries him backwards ten or fifteen feet more and then for no apparent reason stops. Only the walls and ceiling continue their drunken dance around him, stretching, bending, even tilting.When Navidson returns  to   the  window,  he  cannot  believe  his brother is standing still. Unfortunately, as Tom demonstrates, whenever hetakes one step foiward, the floor drags him two steps back. Navidson quickly begins to crawl through  the  window,  and  oddly  enough  the  walls and ceiling almost instantly cease their oscillations.What happens next happens so fast it is  impossible  to  realize  just how brutal the closure was before it is already over. Only the after-effects create an image commensurate with the shutter like speed with which those walls snapped shut and shattered all the fingers in  both  of  Tom's outstretched hands. Bones "like bread sticks" (Reston's words)308 now jut out through the flesh.  Blood  covers  his  arms, as  well  as  pours  from  his nose and ears.For a moment, Tom looks like he is going to slip into  shock  as  he stares at his mutilated body."Goddamn it Tom, run!" Navidson shouts.And Tom tries, though  his  effort  only  sweeps  him  farther  away from his brother. This time when he stops, he knows he has no chance."Hang on, I'm coming to get you," Navidson yells, as he squeezes himself all the way onto the kitchen counter."Aw Christ," Tom mutters. Navidson looks up."What?"Whereupon Tom disappears.In less time than it takes for a single frame of film to flash upon a screen, the linoleum floor dissolves, turning the kitchen into a vertical  shaft. Tom tumbles into the blackness, not even a scream flung  up  behind  him to mark his fall, Navidson's own scream ineffectually scratching after him, his twin, stolen  and  finally  mocked  in  silence,  not  even  the  sound  of  Tom hitting the bottom, which is how it might have remained had not some strange and unexpected intrusion, out of the blue, returned Tom's end in the shape of an awful gasp, heard by Reston, perhaps by Karen who suddenly groaned, and certainly  by  Chad  who  crouched  among the trees,  listening and finally watching over the sobs of  his  father  and  little  sister  until something dark and unknown told him to find his mother.308Due to the darkness and insufferable limitations of the Hi 8s, the chaotic  bits  of tape  representing  these events must be supplemented with  Billy's narration. Navidson, however, does not discuss any  of these horrific  moments  in  The Last Interview.  Instead  he  makes  Reston the  sequence's  sole  authority.  This  is odd, especially since Reston saw none of it. He is only recounting what Navidson told him himself. 1be general consensus has always been  that  the  memory  is simply  too painful for Navidson to  revisit. But there is another possibility: Navidson refuses to abandon the more perspicacious  portion of his audience. By relying on Reston as the sole narrative voice, he subtly draws attention once again to the question  of inadequacies  in  representation,  no  matter  the  medium,  no  matter   how  flawless.  Here  in   particular,   he mockingly  emphasizes   the   fallen  nature   of  any   history  by   purposefully   concocting   an   absurd   number of generations. Consider: I.

It only offers distance and in rare cases perspective.346 XIV"Let you be stripped ofyour purple dyes,for I too once in the wilderness with my wife had all the treasure I wished."- EnkiduTo\?lrl the end of October, Navidson went up to Lowell to take care of his brother's things. He assured Karen he would join her and the children by the first of November. Instead he flew straight back down to Charlottesville. When Thanksgiving came and went and Navidson still had not made it to New York, Karen called Fowler.Following the release of The Navidson Record, Audrie McCullogh, who helped Karen build the bookshelf, briefly discussed the Navidsons' relationship in a radio interview (a transcript can be obtained by writing to KCRW in Los Angeles). In it Audrie claimed the decision not to get married always came from Karen: "Navy would have married her in a second. She was always the one against it. She wanted her freedom and then would go berserk when he was away. Her whole affair with Fowler was about that. Seeing someone else but not ... agh, I shouldn't get into that."309After Navidson had vanished down the Spiral Staircase, Karen found herself trapped between two thresholds: one leading into the house, the other leading out of it. Even though she finally did succeed in leaving Ash Tree Lane and in some respects Navidson, she was still incapable of entering any sort of dark enclosed place. Even in New York she refused to take subways and always avoided elevators.The reasons are not at all obvious. The leading theory now depends on a history given by Karen's estranged older sister Linda. Earlier this year, she went on a public access "talk show" and described how they had beensexually abused by their stepfather. According to her, one fall weekend while their mother was away, he took both girls to an old farmhouse where he forced Karen (age fourteen) down into a well and left her there while he raped Linda. Later, he forced Linda down the well and did the same to Karen.The pharmacotherapy study Karen participated in never mentionsany history of sexual abuse (see footnote 69). However it does not seem unreasonable to consider a traumatic adolescent experience, whether a fantasy or real, as a possible source for Karen's fears. Unfortunately when asked by various reporters to confirm her sister's claim, Karen refused to comment.309Audrie McCu11ogh interviewed by Li.za Richardson on "Bare Facts," KCRW, Los Angeles, June 16, 1993.347 Navidson also refuses to comment, stating only that Karen's already natural fear of that place was worsened  by  her  severe  "claustrophobia."  In The Navidson Record, Karen describes her anxiety in  very simple  terms: "Green lawns in the afternoon, warm I00 watt bulbs, sunny beaches,  all  of them, heaven. But get me near an elevator or a poorly lit  basement  and   I'll freak. A blackout can paralyze me. It's clinical. I was once part of a study but the drugs they gave me made me fat."More than likely no one will ever learn whether or  not  the stories about the well and Karen's stepfather are true.After a decade of distance, the house was supposed to be a new beginning. Navidson gave up assignments abroad and Karen vowed to concentrate on raising their family. They both wanted and for that matter needed what neither one could  really  handle.  Navidson  quickly  took  refuge in his documentary. Regrettably for Karen, his work was still at home. He played more with the children, and every day filled the rooms with his substantial energy and natural authority. Karen  was  not  strong  enough  to define her own space. She needed help.Except in those objects housing evidence of her adultery,  Karen's affair with Fowler barely  exists  in The  Navidson  Record.  It  was  not  until the film began to succeed that details concerning this relationship, however spurious, began to emerge.Fowler was an actor living in New York. He  worked at a Fifth Avenue clothing store, specializing in Italian cuts for women.  He  was considered consummately attractive and spent his evenings talking about acting down at the Bowery Bar, Naked Lunch, or Odelay-la. Apparently he picked up Karen on the street.Literally.Rushing to meet her mother for  dinner, Karen  had  stepped  off the curb and turned her  ankle.  For  a dazed  instant  she  lay  on  the  asphalt  amid the scattered contents of her bag-der absoluten Zerrissenheit.3 10 An instant later,  Fowler  reached  down  and  lifted her back onto  the sidewalk. He gathered up her things and paid attention to her. By the time he was gone, she had given him her number and two days  later  when  he  called  she had agreed to a drink.After all,  he  was  consummately  attractive,  and  even  more  appealing to Karen, he was stupid.This had taken place when Navidson and Karen were still living in New York City, a year before they bought the  house  in  Virginia.  Navidson was off taking aerial pictures of barges off the Norwegian coast. Once348 again, Karen resented being left alone with the children. Audrie claimed she was "desperate for a way out."311 Fowler's timing could not have been better.Audrie stopped short of revealing much about the affair, but Karen's sister, Linda, offered a pornographic recounting which many took seriously until they realized she had been out of touch with Karen for at least three years. The only source for this story comes by way of Fowler. No doubt the attention he received from the media was too much for a struggling actor to give up. Nor is there any question that he embellished to keep the media interested."She's a great lady" Fowler first told reporters." And it wouldn't be cool to talk about it, about us, I mean."312 And then a little later to some tabloid reporters, "What we had was special. Ours. You know what I mean. I don't have to explain what we did or where we did it. We went to the park, had a drink, talked. I tried to show her some fun. We're friends now. I wish her well, I do." And still later, "She wanted a divorce.313 That guy didn't treat her well. She fell down in the street and I picked her up. She'd never had anyone do that for her before."314Fowler probably never realized how wrong he was. Not only hadNavidson carried Karen out of that house, he had picked her up a hundred times over the course of eleven years and carried her fear, her torment and her distance. In a rare moment, Reston called in on a late-night radio show and lambasted the host for promoting such ridiculous gossip: "Let me tell you this, Will Navidson did everything for that woman. He was solid. Once, for a thirteen month stretch, she wouldn't let him touch her. But he never budged. Loved her just the same. I doubt that punk would have lasted a week. So give it a rest @$$hole" and before the subject could turn to the house or anything else, Reston hung up.315Eventually Fowler moved on to other things. He married a pomstarand disappeared into a very disagreeable world.Rumours still insist Karen had other affairs. As beautiful as she was, it is not hard to believe she had suitors. Strangers were constantly writing her love letters, delivering expensive perfumes, sending her plane tickets to far off places. Supposedly she sometimes responded. There was someone in Dallas, someone in L.A. and several in London and Paris. Audrie, however, claims Karen only flirted and her indiscretions never went further than a coy drink or a curt meal. She maintains that Karen never slept with any of them. They were just a means to escape the closeness of any relationship, particularly the one with the man she loved most.It is pretty certain Navidson knew about "the love letters Karen hid in her jewelry box."316 But what intrigues many critics these days is the manner in which he chose to regard that curious object. As semiotician Clarence Sweeney wrote:While Navidson refused to make her infideli- ties a 'public' part of the film, he seemed311Interview with Audrie McCuUogh.

No doubt his knowledge of Fowler, the cache of letters, certainly the discovery of Wax and Karen's kiss, contributed to bis decision to return to the house for one more exploration.320 He left her to New York because by then he knew she was already gone. And she was.Jerry Liebennan who wrote the original People interview with Fowler had spoken with the would-be-actor for a possible follow up article but lack of interest in the affair caused him to shelve the story. After a little haggling, he agreed to send the tape of their last conversation. Here then for the first time is what Fowler told Liebennan on July 13, 1995:Yeah, she called me up, said she was in town, how 'bout a drink, that sort of thing. So we go out a few times. I fuck her a few times, you know what I mean, but she's not talking much now. Only thing she says is she's working on some film short. I asked her if there's a part for me but she tells me it's not that kind of film.I must have seen her two or three maybe four times. It was fun and all but she looked like hell and I didn't like taking her around. She'd changed over the months, pale, darker, didn't smile much, and when she did it was kinda dif- ferent than before, kinda quirky, weird, real personal.She looked her age too. Too old for me really and with kids and all and well, time to move on. Those things happen you know.Anyway I didn't need to worry that she'd get  clingy  or  anything.  She  wasn't  that type    of lady. The last time we went out, she said she only had a few minutes. She had to get back to that film she was editing or whatever. Somethingyou,    you 319Mr. Truant is refening here to his biological father not Raymond, his fosterfather. - Ed.320Covered in greater detail in Chapters XVII and XIX.351 about interviews and family movies. And that was that. She shook my hand and left.But I'll tell you, she was different from when I first met her. I've fucked around with married women before. I know how they get off on dicking over their husband. She wasn't like that now. She needed him. I could see that in her eyes. It wasn't the first time either I seen a mar- ried woman get eyes like that. Suddenly they want what they got off getting away from in the first place. It's all fucked up. And she was like that. All fucked up and needing him. But as that story usually goes, he wasn't around no more.321Which was true. Navidson was no longer around, except of course Karen still saw him every day and in a way she had never seen him before-not as a projection of her own insecurities and demons but just as Will Navidson, in flickering light, flung up by a 16mm projector on a paint-white wall.321 Courtesy of Jerry Lieberman.352 xvMit seinen Nachtmi.itzen und Schlafrockfetzen Stopft er die Lucken des Weltenbaus.-  Heine322Karen Green sits on a park bench in Central Park. She wears  a russet sweater and a black cashmere scarf. All around her we see people milling about, enjoying one of those  sparkling  February  days  New  York City sometimes deigns to  deliver.  Patches  of  snow  lie on  the  ground, children shriek, carriages clatter past taxi cabs and traffic  cops.  A  war  is going on in the Persian Gulf but those affairs hardly seem to matter here. As Karen explains, more than a little time has passed:It's been four months since we escaped from our house. It's also four months since I've seen Navy. As far as I know, he's still in Charlottesville with Billy- conduct- ing experiments.[She coughs lightly]We used to talk on the phone but now even that's stopped. This whole experience has changed him. Losing Tom, I think changed him the most.I've called, written, done everything short of going down there, which is something I refuse to do. I'm up here taking care of our children and looking after his film. He did some work on it but then he just stopped and shipped me al of it, the negatives, the tapes, the whole mess. Still, he won't leave Virginia. And to think, two months ago he told me he was only going to need a few more days.My mother keeps telling me to get rid of him and sellthe house. I'm thinking about it but in the meantime I've been working on the film. There was so much of it I de- cided to cut it down to thirteen  minutes $  to  find outwhat people thought of it.322"W ith his nightcaps and the tatters of his dressing-gown he patches up the gaps in the structure of the universe"-which he quoted in full to his wife, as well as alluded to in chapter Six of The Interpretation of Dreams and in a letter to Jung dated February 25, 1908_323323Heine?324324Freud. - Ed.$ More than likely, an eight minute version of Karen's abridgment became the second short now known as "Exploration #4."

However when Miramax put the film in wide release, What Some Have Thought was absent. At a Cannes press junket, Bob Weinstein argued that  the  section  was  too  self- referential and too far fro m"the spine of the story" to justify  its  inclusion.  "Audiences just want  to  get  back to the house" he explained. "The delay that piece caused was unbearable.  But don't worry,  you'll  have  it  in the DVD release."328328To date, I haven't heard back from any of the people quoted in this "transcript" with the  exception  of  Hofstadter  who  made  it  very  clear he'd never heard of  Will  Navidson,  Karen  Green  or  the  house  and  Paglia who scribbled on a postcard: "Get lost, jerk." 354 Leslie Stern, M.D. Psychiatrist.Setting: Her office.

Does it have some kind of, well, ... meaning ?Stern: There you go again with "meaning." I gave up meaning a long time ago. Trying to get a table at Elaine's is hard enough.

Architect	& Structural Engineer.Setting: Inside St. Patrick's Cathedral.Antipala: [Very high-strung; speaks very fast] The things that came to me, now I guess this is just the way my mind works or something, but the whole house prompted these questions, which I guess, like you said, is, uh, what you're after. Though they're not exactly concerned with meaning, I think.[Pause]Karen: What were the questions?Antipala: Oh god, a whole slew of them. Anything from what the soil bearing capacity of a place like that would have to be to, uh, say, well uh ... Well first, I mean go back to just soil bearing capacity.  That's a very  complicated  question. I mean, look umassive rock" like trap rock for instance can stand up to 1000 metric tons per square meter while sedimentary rock, like hard shale or sandstone for in- stance, will crumble with anything over 150 metric tons per square meter. And soft clay's not even worth 10 met- ric tons. So that place, beyond dimension, impossibly high, deep, wide -what kind of foundation is it sitting on? And if it's not, I mean if it's like a planet, surrounded by space, then its mass is still great enough it's gonna have a lot of gravity, driving it al inward, and what kind of material then at its core could support all that?Douglas   R.

If the arrow is here at A and the target is here at B, then in the course of getting to B the arrow must travel at least half that distance which 11call point C. Now  in  get- ting from C to B the arrow must travel  half that distance, call that point D, and so on. Well the fun starts when you realize you can keep dividing up space forever, paring it down into smaller and smaller fractions until ... well, the arrow never reaches B.Byron   Baleworth.

Just as a nasty virus resists the body's immunesystem so your symbol-the house-resists interpreta- tion.Karen: Does that mean it's meaningless?Baleworth: That's a long  conversation.  I'm  staying  at  the Plaza Athenee for the next few  nights. Why  don't  we have dinner? [Pause] That thing's off, right?Karen: Well give me a rough idea how you'd tackle the ques- tion?Baleworth:  [Suddenly uncomfortable]  I'd  probably  turn  to the filmmaking. Meaning would come  if  you  tied  the house to politics, science, or psychology. Whatever you like but something. And the monster. I'm sorry but the monster needs work. For Pete's sake, is that thing on?!Andrew   Ross.   Literature	professor	at Princeton University.Setting: Gym. Ross works out with a medicine ball.Ross: Oh the monster's the best part.  Baleworth's  a play-  wright and as far as the English go probably a356 traditionalist when it comes to ghost stories. Quite a few Brits you know still prefer their ghosts decked in crepe and cobweb, candelabra in one hand. Your monster, however, is purely American. Edgeless for one thing, something a compendium of diverse cultures definitely requires. You can't identify this creature with any one group. Its individuality is imperceptible, and like the dark side of the moon, invisible but not without influence.You know when I first saw the monster, I thought itwas a Keeper. I still think that. It's a very mean House Keeper who vigilantly makes sure the house remains void of absolutely everything. Not even a speck of dust. It's a maid gone absolutely nutso.Have you ever worn a maid's outfit?Jennifer	Antlpala.Antipala: And what about the walls? Load-bearing? Or non- load-bearing walls? That takes me from questions about foundation material to building material. What could that place possibly be made of? And I'm thinking right now of the shifting that goes on, so that means we're not talking dead loads, which means a fixed mass, but live loads which must deal with wind, earthquakes and variance of motion within the structure. And that shifting is that the same say as wind-pressure distributions?, which is some- thing like, something like, uh, oh yeah, P equals one half beta times V squared times C times G, uh, uh, uh, that's it, that's it, yeah that's it, or something like that, where P is wind pressure on the structure's surface ... or do I have to go someplace else, look at wall bending or wall stresses, axial and lateral forces, but if we're not talking wind, what from then and how? how implemented? how offset? and I'm talking now about weight disbursement, some serious loading's going on there . . . I mean any- thing that big has got to weigh a lot. And I mean at the very least a lot-lot. So I keep asking myself: how cm I go- ing to carry that weight? And I really don't have a clue. So I start looking for another angle.[Moves closer to Karen]Camille Paglia. Critic.Setting: The Bowery Bar patio.Paglia: Notice only men go into it. Why? Simple: women don't have to. They know there's nothing there and can live with that knowledge, but men must find out for sure. They're haunted by that infinite hollow and its sense- making allure, and so they crave it, desire it, desire its end, its knowledge, its-to use here a Strangelove-ian phrase-its essence. They must penetrate, invade, conquer, destroy, inhabit, impregnate and if necessary even be consumed by it. It really comes down to what men lack. They lack the hollow, the uterine cavity, any creative life-yielding physiological incavation. The whole thing's about womb envy or vagina envy, whatever you prefer.329Karen: What about my character's fear of darkness.Paglia: Pure fabrication. The script was  written  by  a  man, right? What self-respecting woman is afraid of the dark? Women are everything that's  internal  and  hidden. Women are darkness. I cover some of this in my book Sexual Personae due out from Vintage in a few months.Are you busy this afternoon?Anne Rice. Novelist.Setting: The Museum  of  Natural History.Rice: Oh I'm not so sure I care for that.  So  much  sexual  pair- ing, this masculine, this feminine . . . I think  it's  too political and obviously a bit strained.Darkness isn't male or female. It's the absence of light, which is important to us because we are all retinal creatures who need light to move around, sustain our- selves and protect ourselves. George Foreman uses his eyes much more than his fists.Of course, light and dark mean a lot less to a bat. What matters more to a bat is whether or not FM fre- quencies are jamming its radar.Harold Bloom. Critic.Setting: His private library. Walls loaded with books. General disarray.Bloom: My dear girl, Kierkegaard once wrote,  "If  the  young man had believed in repetition, of what might he not been  cap  able?   What  inwardness   he   might   have  at- tained."329Melissa Schemell in her book Absent Identification (London: Emunah Publishing Group, 1995), p. 52. discusses sexual modes of recognition:The house as vagina: Tbe adolescent boy's primary identification lies with the mother. The subsequent realization that he is unlike her (he has a penis; sbe doesn't; he is different) results in an intense feeling of displacement and loss. The boy must seek out a new identity (the fa- ther) ... Navidson explores that loss, that which he first identified with: the vagina, the womb, the mother.Eri c Keplard's Maternal Intrusions (Portland: Nescience Press, 1995), p. 139, also speaks of that place as something motherly, only his reading is far more historical than Schemel's: "Navidson's house is an incarnation of his own mother. In other words: absent. It represents the unresolved Oedipal drama which continually intrudes on his relationship with Karen." That said it would be unfair not to mention Tad Exler's book Our Father (Iowa City: Pavemockurnest Press, 1996) which rejects "the over-enthusiastic parallels with motherdom" in favor of "narcissism's paternal darkness."358 We'll touch on your, uh,  unfinished  piece  shortly, but please permit me first to  read  you  a page  from  my book The Anxiety Of Influence. This  is  from  the  chapter on Kenosis:The unheimlich, or "unhomely" as the "uncanny," is perceived wher- ever we are reminded of our inner tendency to yield to obsessive patterns of action. Overruling the pleasure  principle,  the  daemonic in oneself yields to a "repetition compulsion." A man and a woman meet, scarcely talk, enter into a covenant of mutual rendings; re- hearse again what they find they have known together before, and yet there was no before. Freud, unheimlich here, in his insight, maintains that "every emotional af- fect, whatever its quality, is transformed by repression into morbid anxiety." Among cases of anxiety, Freud finds  the  class  of the  uncanny,  "in  which  the  anxi- ety can be shown to come from something repressed which re- curs." But this  "unhomely"  might as well be called "the homely," he observes, "for this uncanny is in reality nothing new or foreign, but something familiar and old- established in the mind that  has been estranged only by the  proc- ess of repression."You see emptiness here is  the  purported  familiar and your house is endlessly familiar, endlessly repetitive. Hallways, corridors, rooms, over and over again. A bit like Dante's house after a good spring cleaning. It's a lifeless objectless place.  Cicero  said  "A  room  without  books  is like a body without a soul." So add souls to the list. A lifeless, objectless, soulless place. Godless too. Milton's abyss pre-god or in a Nietzschean universe post-god.330While unheimlich has already recurred within this text,  there  has  up  to  now  been  no  treatment  of  the English word uncanny. While lacking the  Gennanic  sense  of "home,"  uncanny  builds  its  meaning  on  the Old English root cunnan from the Old Norse Kunna which  has  risen  from  the  Gothic  Kunnan  (preterite- present verbs) meaning kllilli from the lndo-European (see OED). The  "y"  imparts  a  sense  of  "full  of' while the "un" negates that which follows. In other words, un-cann-y  literally  breaks  down  or  disassembles into that which is IlQl fi!.ll of knowing or conversely full  of nQ1  knowing;  and  so  without  understanding exactly what repetitive denial still successfully keeps repressed and  thus estranged, though  indulging  in repetition nonetheless, that which is uncanny may be defined as empty of knowledge and knowing  or  at  the same time surfeit with the absence of knowledge  and  knowing.  In  the  words  of  Perry  Ivan  Nathan Shaftesbury, author of Murder's Gate: A Treatise On love and Rage (London: Verso, 1996), p. 183: "It is therefore sacred, inviolate,  forever  preserved.  The  ultimate  virgin.  The  husbandless  madonna.  Mother  of God. Mother of Mother. Inhuman." See also Anthony Vidler's The Architectural Uncanny: Essays In The Modern Unhomely (Cambridge, Massachusetts: The MIT Press, 1992).359  It is so pointedly against symbol,  the  house  re- quires a symbol destroyer. But that lightless fire leaving the  wal  ls permanently  ashen  and,  to  my  eye,   obsidian smooth is still nothing more than the artist's Procrustean way of combating influence: to create  a  featureless golem, a universal eclipse, Jacob's angel, Mary's Frank- enstein, the great eradicator of  al  that  is and  ever  was and thus through this trope succeed in securing poetic independence no matter how lonely, empty, and ago- nizing the final result may be.My dear girl, is it that you are so lonely that  you  had to create this?A Poet. 21 years old.

Hofstadter.Hofstadter: Similar to Zeno's arrow, consider the following equation: 1/a =?EMBED "Equation" \* mergeformat ODD where 1/oo = 0.If we apply this to your friend  Bloom's  poetics  we get an interesting perspective on the monster.Let 1 mean the artist, then let "a" equal 1 which stands  for  one   influence   and   we   get  1 for  an  answer,}. =1,  or a level of one influence  which  I take  to  mean l2.:la! influence.If however we divide by 2 then the influence level drops to 1/2 and so on. Take the number of influences to infinity, where a = oo, and voila you have an influence  level of zero, A =0.Now let's take this formula into account as we con- sider your monster. It has cleared the  walls  and  corridors of everything. In other words, it has been influenced by infinity and therefore not influenced  at  all.  But  then  look at the result: it's lightless, featureless, and empty.I don't know maybe a little influence is a goodthing.Byron Baleworth.Baleworth: You need to  refine how the  house  itself serves as a symbol - Stephen	King.

Conse- quently it's unforgettable. Well that house of yours in your movie definitely sparks awe and all the disbelief, but in my mind it never makes sense. I trace the lines, do the math, study the construction, and all I come up with is ... well the whole thing's just a hopeless, structural impos- sibility. And therefore substanceless and forgettable.

The quality of image is  often  terrible  except when Will Navidson handles the camera which does not happen often enough. The sound is poor. The elision of many details contributes to insufficiently developed characters. And finally the overall structure creaks and teeters, threatening at any minute to  collapse.  That  said (or in this case typed) I remain soberly impressed and dis- turbed. I even had a dream about your house. If I didn't know better I'd say you weren't  a filmmaker at  all.

Thanks to her, Karen goes on to fashion another short piece in which she, surprisingly enough, never mentions the house, let alone any of the comments made by the gliterati.It is an extraordinary twist. Not once are those multiplying hallwaysever addressed. Not once does Karen dwell on their darkness and cold. She produces six minutes of film that has absolutely nothing to do with that place. Instead her eye (and heart) tum to what matters most to her about Ash Tree Lane; what in her own words (wearing the same russet sweater; sitting on the same Central Park bench; coughing less) "that wicked place stole from me."So in the first black frame, what greets us is not sinister but blue: the strains of Charlie "Y ardbird" Parker coaxing out of the darkness the precocious face of a seventeen year old Will Navidson.Piece after piece of old Kodak film, jerky, over exposed, under exposed, usually grainy, yellow or overly red, coalesce to form a rare glimpse of Navidson's childhood-nicht allzu glatt und gekiinstelt. 332 His father-drinking ice tea. His mother-a black and white headshot on the mantle. Tom-watering the lawn. Their golden retriever, the archetype for all home movie dogs, frolicking in the sprinklers, pouncing on the pale green hose as if it were a python, barking at Tom, then at their father, even though as its jaws snap open and shut it is impossible to hear a bark-only Charlie Parker playing to the limits of his art, lost in rare delight.As professor Erik Von Jarnlow poignantly remarked:I don't think I'm alone in feeling the immutable sadness contained in these fragments. Perhaps that is the price of remembering, the price of perceiving accurately. At least with such sor- row must come knowledge. 333332MNot overly polished or artificial." - Ed.333See Erik Von Jarnlow's Summer's Salt (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1996), p. 593.366 Karen progresses steadily from  Navidson's  sundrenched  backyard to a high school prom, his grandmother's funeral, Tom covering his eyes in front of a barbecue, Navidson diving headfirst into a swimming hole. Then college graduation, Will hugging Tom good-bye as he prepares to leave for Vietnam,334 a black and white shot catching the wing of his plane in flight.And then the whole private history explodes.Suddenly a much  larger  world  intrudes  on  the  boyish  Navidson. Fam ily portraits are replaced by pictures of tank drivers in Cambodia, peasants hauling empty canisters of nerve gas to  the  side  of  the  road, children selling soda near body bags smeared  with  red  oil-soaked  clay, crowds in Thailand, a murdered man in Israel, the dead in Angola; fractions plucked from the stream, informing the recent  decades, sometimes even daring to suggest a whole.And yet out of the thousands of pictures Navidson took, there doesnot exist a single frame without a person in it. Navidson never snapped scenery. People mattered most to him, whether soldiers, lepers, medics, or newlyweds eating dinner at a trattoria in Rome, or even a family of tailors swimming alone at some sandy cove north of Rio. Navidson  religiously studied others. The world around only mattered because  people  lived  there and sometimes,  in spite of the pain, tragedy, and  degradation,  even managed to triumph there.Though Karen gives her piece the somewhat faltering title A Brief History Of Who I Love, the use of Navidson's photos, many of them prize-winning, frequently permits the  larger  effects  of the  late  20th  century to intrude. Gordon Burke points out the emotional significance of this alignment between personal and cultural pasts:Not only do we appreciate Navidson  more,  we are inadvertently touched by the world at large, where other individuals, who have faced such terrible horrors, still manage to  walk  barefoot and burning from the grave.335Each of Navidson's photographs consistently reveals how vehemently he despised life's destruction and how desperately he sought to preserve its fleeting beauties, no matter the circumstances.Karen, however, does not need to point  any  of this  out.  Wisely  she lets Navidson's work speak  for  itself.  Interestingly  enough  though,  her labor of love does not close with one of his photographs but rather with a couple of shots of Navidson himself. The first  image-purportedly taken  by a famous though now deceased photojournalist-shows him when he was a young soldier in South East Asia, dressed in battle fatigues, sitting on an ammunition crate with howitzer shell casings stacked on a  nearby  trunk marked "VALUABLES." An open window to the right is obviously  not enough to clear the  air.  Navidson  is  alone,  head  down,  fingertips  a blur  as he sobs into his hands over an  experience  we  will  undoubtedly  never  share but perhaps can  still  imagine.  From  this  heart-wrenching  portrait,  Karen ever so gently dissolves to the last shot of her piece, actually a clip of Super334According to Melanie Proft Knightley in  War's  Children  (New  York:  Zone Books,  1994),  p.  110,  a weak heart prevented Tom from getting drafted. Navidson had gone ahead and enlisted.335See the introduction by Gordon Burke in Will Navidson's Pieces (New York: Harry N. Abrams, Inc.,1994), p. xvii.367 8 which she herself took not long before they  moved  to  Virginia  Navidson is goofing around in the snow with Chad and Daisy. They are throwing snowballs, making  snow  angels,  and enjoying  the  clarity  of the  day.  Chad is laughing on his father's shoulders as Navidson scoops up Daisy and holds her up  to the blinding sun.  The  film,  however,  cannot follow  them.  It is badly overexposed. All three of them vanish in a burst of light.0000The diligence, discipline, and time-consuming research required to fashion this short-there are easily over  a hundred  edits-allowed  Karen  for the first time to see Navidson as something other than her own personal fears and projections. She witnessed for herself how much he cherished the human will to persevere. She again and again saw in his pictures and his expressions the longing and tenderness he felt toward her and their children. And then quite unexpectedly, she came across the meaning of his privately guarded obsession.While Navidson's work bas many remarkable images of individualschallenging fate, over a third captures the meaning of defeat-those seconds after an execution, the charred fingers found in the rubble of a bombed township, or the dull-blue look of eyes which in the final seconds of life could still not muster enough strength to close. In her filmic sonnet, Karen includes a shot of Navidson's Pulitzer Prize-winning photograph. As she explains in a voice-over: "The print comes from Navy's personal collection." The same one hanging in their home and one of the first things Navidson placed in their car the night they fled.As the world remembers, the renowned image  shows  a  Sudanese child dying of starvation, too weak to move even though a vulture stalks her from behind. 336 Not only does  Karen  spend  twenty  seconds  on  this picture, she then cuts to a ten second shot of the back of the print. Without saying a word, she zooms in tighter and tighter on  the  lower  right hand comer, until her subject finally becomes clear: there, almost lost amidst  so much white, lie six faintly penciled in block letters cradled in quotes-"Delial"ODDOThere are only 8,160 frames in Karen's  film  and  yet  they  serve  as the perfect counterpoint to that infinite stretch of hallways, rooms and stairs. The house is empty, her piece is full. The house is dark, her film glows.  A growl haunts that place, her place is blessed by Charlie Parker. On Ash Tree Lane stands a house of darkness, cold, and emptiness. In 16mm  stands  a house of light, love, and colour.336Th.is is clearly based on Kevin Carter's 1994 Pulitzer Prize-winning photograph of a vulture preying on a tiny Sudanese girl who collapsed on her way to a feeding center. Carter enjoyed many accolades for the shot but was also accused of gross insensitivity. The Florida St. Petersburg Times wrote: "The man adjusting his lens to take Just the right frame of her suffering might Just as well be a predator, another vulture on the scene.ð Regrettably constant exposure to violence and deprivation, coupled with an increased dependency on drugs exacted a high price. On July 27, 1994 Carter killed himself. - Ed.368 By following her heart, Karen made sense of what that place was not. She also discovered what she needed more than anything else. She stopped seeing Fowler, cut off questionable liaisons with other suitors, and while her mother talked of breaking up, selling the house, and settlements, Karen began to prepare herself for reconciliation.Of course she had no idea what that would entail. Or how far she would have to go.369 XVIWhen mathematical propositions refer to reality they are not certain; when they are certain, they do not refer to reality.- Albert EinsteinUp until now The Navidson Record has focused principally on the effects the house has had on others: how Holloway became murderous and suicidal, Tom drank himself into oblivion, Reston lost his mobility, Sheriff Axnard went into a state of denial,  Karen  fled  with  the  children,  and Navidson grew increasingly more isolated and obsessed. No consideration, however, has been given to the house as it relates purely to itself.Examined then from as objective a point  of  view  as  possible  the house offers these incontrovertible facts: 1.02.03.04.05.06.0 No light.No humidity.No air movement (i.e. breezes, drafts etc).

Once he left the house, however, he began to consider new evidence: namely the collected wall samples.In lush colour, Navidson captures those time-honored  representa- tions of science: test tubes bubbling with boric  acid,  reams  of  computer paper bearing the black-ink weight of analysis, electron microscopes resurrecting universes out of dust, and mass-spectrometers with retractable Faradays and stationary Balzers  humming  in some dim approximation of life.In all these images there is  a wonderful  sense  of security.  The  labs are clean, well-lit, and ordered. Computers seem to print with a purpose. Various instruments promise answers, even  guarantees.  Still  in  order  to  make sure all this apparatus does not come across as  too  sterile,  Navidson  also includes shots of the life-support system: a Krups coffee maker hissing and bubbling, an Oasis poster taped  to  the  vending  machine,  Homer Simpson on the lounge TV saying something to his brother Herbert.As  a favor to  Reston,  petrologist Mel  O'Geery,  up  at  the Princetongeology department, has agreed to donate his spare time and oversee the examination of all the wall samples. Prone toward bird like gestures, he is a slight man who takes great delight in speaking very quickly. For nearly four months, he has analyzed every piece of matter, all the  way  from  A (taken  a few feet into the  first hallway)  to  XXXX  {taken  by  Navidson  when  he found himself alone at the bottom of the Spiral Staircase). It is not an371 inexpensive undertaking, and while the university has agreed to fund most of it, apparently Navidson also had to throw in a fair amount himself.337Setting out all the sample bottles on a long table, Dr. O'Geery provides the camera with a summation of his findings, casually gesturing to various groupings while he sips coffee from a Garfield mug."What we have here is a nice banquet of igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic samples, some granular, possibly gabbro and pyroxenite, some with much less grain, possibly trachite or andesite. The sedimentary group is fairly small, samples F through K, mainly limestone and marl. The metamorphic group predominates with traces of amphibolite and marble. But this group here, it's composed primarily of siderites, which is to say heavy in iron, though you also have aerolites rich in silicon and magnesium oxides."[2 pages missing]337The actual sum is never made clear in the film.

With a few exceptions, most meteors  are  younger.  Micrometeorites,  however,  with  high levels of deuterium, suggest evidence of interstellar material predating our solar system. See F.

Navidson presses. O'Geery shakes his head."Well except maybe the chronology." "Meaning?" Reston eases his wheelchair forward."Your samples all fall into a very consistent scheme. Sample A is pretty young, a few thousand years old,  while  K  is  a  few  hundred thousand. Q over here is in the millions and these-" referring to MMMM through XXXX "-well, in the billions. Those last bits there are clearly meteoric.""Meteors?" Navidson shoots a look at Reston.O'Geery nods, picking up the sample marked VVVV. "In my opinion Rubidium-87/strontium-87 is the best dating  method  we  have, yielding formation ages anywhere from 4.4 to 4.7 billion  years  old.  If  we place the age of the earth at around four and a half billion  years  old,  it's pretty obvious these had to come from someplace other than  here.  I doubt lunar but maybe interplanetary. XXXX, your  last  sample, is by far the oldest and most interesting. A composite of younger  material, 4.2  billion years old, combined with deuterium rich particles suggesting that  possibly, now I want to stress possibly here, but this deuterium could indicate matter older than even our solar system. Interstellar perhaps. So there  you  have it-a very nice little vein of history."Reston wheels back around to the table, as if Dr. O'Geery's expla- nation should now somehow cast the samples in a new light. Nothing about them, however, has changed. As Gillian Fedette exclaimed on August 4th, l996 at The Radon Conference in St. Paul, Minneapolis: "Not surprisingly, despite [O'Geery's] analysis, the samples continue to remain obdurate and lifeless.""Where did you say you got all this from?" O'Geery asks." Antarc-tica?"Primarily thanks to O'Geery's conclusions, some fanatics of TheNavidson Record assert that the presence of extremely old cbondrites defmitively proves extra-terrestrial forces constructed the house. Others, however, claim the samples only  support  the idea  that  the  house  on  Ash Tree Lane is a self-created portal into some other dimension.351 As  Justin Krape dryly remarked: "Both arguments are probably best attributed to the persistent presence of schizophrenia plaguing the human race.

In chapter 13, Keepling credits The Navidson Record  with  the  revival   of  the  Hollow  Earth  Movement. Tracing this implausible theory from the wobbly ratiocinations of John  Cleaves  Symmes  (1779-1829) through Raymond Bernard's The Hollow Earth: The Greatest Geographical Discovery in History (1964) to Norma Cox's self-published pro-Nazi piece Kingdoms Within Earth (1985), Keepling reveals yet another bizarre subculture thriving  in  the Western world. Of course even  if  this  planet  were  truly  a  hollow globe-an absolute impossibility-Tom's dropped quarter still describes a space far greater than the earth's radius (or even diameter).Justin Krape's Pale Micturitions(Charleston, West Virginia: Kanawha Press, 1996), p. 99.378 354 380 caused by Tom's death and Karen's flight. He only speculates with Reston about what it could mean that samples A thru XXXX form a timeline extending back before the birth of even the  solar  system.  He  uses  his  camera to embrace the Princeton laboratory equipment, seek out the appeasement of numbers, all the while never  openly  reflecting  on  the  very real absence continuing to  penetrate  his life. Similar to the way Karen tried to rely on Feng Shui to mitigate the effects of the house,  Navidson  turns  to the time telling tick of radioactive isotopes to deny the darkness eviscerating him from within.Noda Yennard believes the key to this sequence does not exist inany of the test results or geological hypotheses but in the margin of  a magazine which, as we can see  for  ourselves,  Navidson  idly  fills with doodles while waiting for Dr. O'Geery to retrieve some additional documentation:Mr. Navidson has drawn a bomb going off. An Atom bomb. An inverted thermonuclear explosion which reveals in the black contours of its clouds, the far- reaching shock-wave, and of course the great pluming head, the internal dimen- sions of his own sorrow.355But even if that is indeed the best way to describe the shape of Navidson's emotional topology, it is still nothing compared to the vision the house ultimately prepares for him.As professor Virgil Q.

He  was  grateful  to have survived and smart enough not to tempt fate twice. "Sure I was obsessed at first, we all were," he says in The Reston Interview. "But I got over it pretty quick. My fascination was never the same  as Navy's.  I enjoy my life at the University. My colleagues, my friends there, the woman I've started to see. I've no desire to court death. After  we escaped,  going  back to the house just didn't interest me."Navidson had a completely different reaction. He could not stopthinking about those corridors and rooms. The house had  taken  hold  of him. In  the  months  following  his  departure  from   Ash   Tree   Lane,   he   stayed at Reston's apartment, alternately sleeping on the couch and the floor, continuously surrounded by books, proofs, and notebooks packed with sketches, maps, and theories. "I put Navy up because he needed  help,  but when the sample analysis brought back minimal results, I knew the time had come to have a heart to heart with him about the future." (The Reston Interview again.)As we witness for ourselves, following their meeting  with  Dr. O'Geery, Navidson and Reston both return home. Reston breaks open  a bottle of Jack, pours two three-finger glasses and hands one to his friend. A little time passes. They finish a second drink. Reston gives it his best shot."Navy" he says slowly. "We made a helluva try but now we're at a dead end and you're broke. Isn't it time to contact National  Geographic or The Discovery Channel?"Navidson does not respond."We can't do this thing alone. We don't need to do it alone."Navidson puts his drink down  and  after  a  long  uncomfortable silence nods."Okay, tomorrow morning we'll call them, we'll send them invita- tions, we'll get the ball rolling."Reston sighs and refills their glasses for a third time. "I' 11drink to that."357MWhoever you are, go out into the evening,/ leaving your room, of which you  know  each bit;/ your house is the last before the  infinite,/  whoever you  are." As  translated by C. F. MacIntyre. Rilke: Selected Poems (Berkeley: University of California  Press, 1940), p. 21. - Ed.384 "Here's to opening things up," Navidson says by way of a toast, then glancing at the photograph of Karen and the children he keeps by the sofa, adds: "And here's to me going home.""After that we got pretty drunk." (The Reston Interview.) "Some- thing neither one of us had done in a long while. When I packed it in, Navy was still awake. Still drinking. Writing in some journal he had. Little did I know what he had planned."The next morning when Reston woke up, Navidson was gone. He had left behind a note of thanks and an envelope for Karen. Reston called New York but Karen had heard nothing. A day later he drove to the house. Navidson's car sat in the driveway. Reston wheeled himself to the front door. It was unlocked. "I sat there for an hour and a half, at least, before I could get the guts to go in."But as Reston eventually found out the house was empty and most startling of all the hallway that had loomed for so long in the east wall was gone.Why Did Navidson Go Back To The House?A great deal of speculation has gone into determining the exact reason why Navidson chose to reenter the house. It is a question The Navidson Record never deals with specifically and which after several years of intense debate has produced no simple answer. Currently there are three schools of thought:I.	The Kellog-Antwerk ClaimII.	The Bister-Frieden-Josephson Criteriam. The Haven-Slocum TheoryThough it would be impossible here to address all their respective nuances, at the very least some consideration needs to be given to their views.358On July 8, 1994 at The Symposium for the Betterment of Interna- tional Cultural Advancement held in Reykjavik, Iceland, Jennifer Kellog and Isabelle Antwerk presented their paper on the meaning and authority of title in the 20th and 21 st century. In their study, they cited Navidson as the perfect example of "one dictated by the logic born out of the need to possess."Kellog and Antwerk point out how even though Navidson and Karen own the house together (both their names appear on the mortgage), Navidson frequently implies that he is the sole proprietor. As he soaps at Reston during a heated argument on the subject of future explorations: "Let's not forget that's my house." Kellog and Antwerk regard this possessiveness as the main reason for Navidson's mind-boggling decision358While bits and pieces of these readings still circulate, they have yet to appear anywhere in their entirety. Purportedly Random House intends to publish a complete volume, though the scheduled release is not until the fall of 200 I .385 to enter the house alone. A month later Norman  Paarlberg  wryly  offered  up the following response to the Reykjavik duo: "The obsession just grew and grew until it was Navidson who was finally possessed by  some  self- destructive notion to go back there and yet completely dispossessed of any rational mechanism to override such an incredibly stupid idea."359Kellog and Antwerk argue that the act of returning was an attempt toterritorialize and thus preside over that virtually  unfathomable  space. However, if their claim is correct that Navidson's preoccupation with the house grew solely out of his need to own it, then other behavioral patterns should have followed suit, which was not the case. For instance,  Navidson never sought to buy out Karen's share of their home. He refused to lure television programs and other corporate sponsors to his  doorstep  which would have further enforced his titular position, at least in  the  eye  of the media. Nor did he ever invest himself in any kind paper writing, lectures, or other acts of publicity.And even if Navidson did mentally equate ownership with knowl- edge, as both Kellog and Antwerk assert  he did, he should have more adamantly sought to name the aspects of his discoveries, which as others would later observe he most certainly did not.A year later at The Conference on the Aesthetics of Mourning held in Nuremberg, Germany on August 18, 1995, an unnamed student   read  on behalf of his professors a paper which people everywhere almost instantly began hailing as The Bister-Frieden-Josephson Criteria. More than its content, its tone practically assured a contentious response.Here for example is the opening salvo directed specifically at The Kellog-Antwerk Claim and their followers:"Refutation One: We do not accept that filmmaking constitutes an act of naming. Image never has and never will posses  proprietary  powers. Though others may deny it, we believe that to this day  the  Adamic  strengths of the word, and  hence  language,  have  never  been  or  ever  will  be successfully challenged."The BFJ Criteria defined ownership as an act of verbal assertion necessarily carried out in public. By refusing to acknowledge The Navidson Record as such an act, The BFJ Criteria could  make  the  question  of personal necessity the salient point for rhetorical negotiation.For the first half of its discourse, The BFJ Criteria chose to concen- trate on guilt and grief. Careful consideration was given to Navidson's excessive exposure  to  traumatic  events  throughout  the  world  and  how  he was affected by witnessing scores of "life-snaps" (The language of The Criteria). Ironically enough, however, it  was  not  until  he   resigned  from those assignments and moved to Ash Tree Lane that death crossed over the threshold and began to roam the halls of his  own  home.  His  twin  brother died there along with two others whom he had personally welcomed into the house.Losing Tom nearly destroyed Navidson. A fundamental part of himself and his past had suddenly vanished. Even worse,  as  The  BFJ Criteria emphasizes, in the final moments of his life, Tom displayed characteristics entirely atypical  of  his day  to  day  behavior.  Navidson  saw his brother  in a completely different light. Not at all sluggish or even359Nonnan Paarlberg, "The Explorer's Responsibility," National Geographic, v. 187, January 1995, p. 120-138. remotely afraid, Tom had acted with determination  and  above  all  else heroism, carrying Daisy out of harm's way before falling to his death.Navidson cannot forgive himself. As he  repeatedly tells  Karen  over the phone: "I was my brother's  keeper.  It  was  me,  I  was  the  one  who should have been with Daisy. I was the one who should have died."The most controversial claim  made  by  The  Bister-Frieden- Josephson contingency is that Navidson began believing  darkness  could offer something other than itself. Quite cleverly The Criteria first lays the groundwork for its argument by recalling the now famous admonition voiced by Louis Merplat, the renowned speleologist who back in 1899 discovered the Blue Skia Cavern: "Darkness is impossible to remember. Consequently cavers desire to return  to  those  unseen  depths  where  they have just been. It is an addiction. No one is ever satisfied. Darkness never satisfies. Especially if it takes something away which it almost always invariably does. "360  Not stopping there, The Criteria then turns to  Lazio Ferma who almost a hundred years later echoed Merplat's  views  when  he slyly observed: "Even the brightest magnesium  flare  can  do  little  against such dark except blind the eyes of the one holding it.  Thus  one  craves  what by seeing one has in fact not  seen."361 Before  finally  quoting  A.  Ballard who famously quipped: "That house  answers  many  yearnings  remembered in sorrow. "362The point of recounting these observations is simply to show howunderstandable it was that for Navidson the  impenetrable  sweep  of  that place soon acquired greater meaning simply because, to quote the Criteria directly, "it was full of unheimliche vorklanger363 and thus represented a means to his own personal propitiation."  The  sharp-bladed  tactics  of The BFJ Criteria, however, are not so naive as to suddenly embrace Navidson's stated convictions about what he  might  find.  Instead  the  Criteria  quite adroitly acknowledges that when Tom died every  "angry,  rueful,  self- indicting tangle" within Navidson suddenly "lit up," producing projections powerful and painful enough to "occlude, deny, and cover" the only reason for their success in the first place: the bl akn ness of that place, "the  utter and perfect blankness."It is nevertheless the underlying position of The Bister-Frieden- Josephson Criteria that Navidson in fact relied on  such  projections  in  order to deny his increasingly more "powerful and motivating Thanatos."  In  the end, he sought nothing less than  to  see  the  house  exact  its  annihilating effects on his own being. Again quoting  directly  from  The  Criteria: "Navidson has one deeply acquired organizing perception:  there  is  no  hope of survival there. Life  is  impossible. And therein lies  the  lesson  of  the house, spoken in syllables of absolute silence, resounding within him like a360Quoted in Wilfred Bluffton's article "HolJow Dark" in The New York  Times,  December  16,  1907,  p. 5:5. Also consider Esther Harlan James' "Crave The Cave: The Color of Obsession," Diss. Trinity College, 1996, p. 669, in which she describes her own addiction to The Navidson Record: "I never shook the feeling that the film, while visceral and involving,  must  pale  in  comparison  to  an  actual,  personal  exploration  of the house. Still, just as Navidson needed more and more of that endless dark, I too found myself feeling the same way about The Navidson Record. In fact as I write this now, I've already seen the film thirty-eight  times and have no reason to believe I will stop going to see it."361Lazlo Ferma's "See No Evil" in Film Comment, v. 29, September/ October 1993, p. 58.362A.

If we desire to live, we can only do so in the margins of that place."The second half of The Bister-Frieden-Josephson Criteria focusesalmost entirely on this question of "desire to live" by analyzing in great detail the contents of Navidson's letter to Karen written the night before his departure. To emphasize the potential "desire" for self-destruction, The Criteria supplies for this section the following epigraph:Noli me tangere. Noli me Legere. Noli me videre.* Noli me - 3 64 *Non enim videbit me homo et viver.365Thus emphasizing the potentially mortal price for beholding what must lie forever lost in those inky folds. Here The Criteria also points out how Navidson' s previous trespasses, with one exception, were structured around extremely concrete objectives: (1) rescuing the Holloway team; and after sinking down the Staircase (2) returning home. The exception, of course, is the very first visit, where Navidson seeks nothing else but to explore the house, an act which nearly costs him his life.Oddly enough, The Criteria does not acknowledge the risk inherent in (1) and (2)-objective or no objective. Nor does it explain why one trespass/journey should suddenly be treated as two.Because The Bister-Frieden-Josephson Criteria then goes on to treat Navidson's letter in great detail and since its appearance in the film is limited to only a few seconds of screen time, it seems advisable, before further commentary,to reproduce a facsimile here:364Jn "Shout Not, Doubt Not" published in Ewig-Weibliche ed.
