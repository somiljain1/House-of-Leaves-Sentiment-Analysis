As Billy described the scene in The Reston Interview:
Navidson's dehydrated, hasn't eaten shit for two days, and now he's dragging supplies out to the car in the middle of a thunderstorm
Every step he talces hurts
And then Daisy stopped screaming
The next clip of Hi 8 shows Navidson reentering the house, shout
ing for Daisy and Chad as he sprints down the hall, heading toward the stairs in order to get back up to the children's bedroom
Though poorly lit with even poorer resolution, we can see in the
video how Navidson uses the door to get in range of Reston, despite the
fact that the hinges are about to give way
just as the door wrenches loose and tumbles into oblivion
The whole thing does not last more than a handful of seconds, but like Reston, Navidson notes how this brief bit of action still leaves a lasting impression
From The Last Interview:
Those last words in particular may sound a bit glib, especially coming from such an esteemed photographer
Nevertheless, in spite of numerous Hi 8s mounted all over the house, Navidson is right: all the images recorded during this segment are inadequate
Too bad Navidson never holds a camera The entire sequence covering the escape from the house is reminiscent of something taken off of a cheap surveillance system in a local bank or

-Eleven
Reston sits on the grass, soaked to the bone but refusing to take shelter
Karen is still unconscious, lying in the car exactly where Navidson put her
Daisy and Chad, however, are still missing
So for that matter is Tom
Navidson is trying to decide how he should reenter the house when the sound of shattering glass draws him to the backyard
"It was definitely a window breaking" Reston remembers
"
Reston recalls watching Navidson disappear around the house
He had no idea what would happen next
Reston was squinting in the rain, when he suddenly saw a shadow separate from the tree line: "By then dawn had begun to creep in but the storm clouds were still keeping the day pretty dark
" Reston immediately assumed it was Navidson but then as the figure got closer he could see it was much smaller than his friend
"A strange walk too
As we can see, Tom finally finds Daisy frozen in the shadow s
Without a word, he sweeps her up in his arms and races back down to the first floor, avoiding the precipitous drop into the living room-the way Navidson had gone-by dashing instead toward the rear of the house
The whole place keeps shuddering and shaking, walls cracking only to melt back together again, floors fragmenting and buckling, the ceiling suddenly rent by invisible claws, causing moldings to splinter, water pipes to rupture, electrical wires to spit and short out
Cradling Daisy in his arms, Tom starts running as fast as he can, trying to out race the shock of the void yawning up behind them
Ahead, Navidson appears in the window
Tom pushes harder, edging closer and closer, until finally as he gets within reach, he holds Daisy out to Navidson who despite the fragments of glass scratching long bloody lines along his forearms, immediately rips her free of the house and into safety

Only the walls and ceiling continue their drunken dance around him, stretching, bending, even tilting
When Navidson returns to the window, he cannot believe his brother is standing still
Unfortunately, as Tom demonstrates, whenever he takes one step foiward, the floor drag s him two steps back
Unfortunately, as Tom demonstrates, whenever he takes one step foiward, the floor drag s him two steps back
Navidson quickly begins to crawl through the window, and oddly enoug h the walls and ceiling almost instantly cease their oscillations
What happen s next happens so fast it is impossib le to realize just how brutal the closure was before it is already over
"Goddamn it Tom, run
" Navidson shouts
And Tom tries, though his effort only sweeps him farther away
This time when he stops, he knows he has no chance
"Hang on, I'm coming to get you ," Navidson yells, as he squeezes
himself all the way onto the kitchen counter
"A w Christ," Tom mutters
Navidson looks up
"What
screen, the linoleum floor dissolve s, turning the kitchen into a vertical shaft
Tom tumbles into the blackness, not even a scream flung up behind him to mark his fall, Navidson's own scream ineffectually scratching after him, his twin, stole n and finally mocked in silence, not even the sound of Tom hitting the bottom, which is how it might have remained had not some strange and unexpected intrusion, out of the blue, returned Tom 's end in the shape of an awful gasp, heard by Reston, perhaps by Karen who suddenly groaned, and certainly by Chad who crouched among the trees, listening and finally watching over the sobs of his father and little sister until something dark and unknown told him to find his mother

Navidson, however, does not discuss any of these horrific moments in The Last Interview
Instead he makes Reston the sequence's sole authority
This is odd, especially since Reston saw none of it
He is only recounting what Navidson told him himself
1be general consensus has always been that the memory is simply too painful for Navidson to revisit

lrl the end of October, Navidson went up to Lowell to take care of his brother's things
He assured Karen he would join her and the children by the first of November
Instead he flew straight back down to Charlottesville
When Thanksgiving came and went and Navidson still had not made it to New York, Karen called Fowler
Following the release of The Navidson Record, Audrie McCullogh, who helped Karen build the bookshelf, briefly discussed the Navidsons' relationship in a radio interview (a transcript can be obtained by writing to KCRW in Los Angeles)

After Navidson had vanished down the Spiral Staircase, Karen found herself trapped between two thresholds: one leading into the house, the other leading out of it
Even though she finally did succeed in leaving Ash Tree Lane and in some respects Navidson, she was still incapable of entering any sort of dark enclosed place

Even though she finally did succeed in leaving Ash Tree Lane and in some respects Navidson, she was still incapable of entering any sort of dark enclosed place
Even in New York she refused to take subways and always avoided elevators
347
Navidson also refuses to comment, stating only that Karen's already natural fear of that place was worsened by her severe "cl austrophobia
" In The Navidson Record, Karen describes her anxiety in very simple terms: "Gree n lawns in the afternoon, warm I 00 watt bulbs, sunny beaches, all of them, heaven

After a decade of distance, the house was supposed to be a new beginning
Navidson gave up assignments abroad and Karen vowed to concentrate on raising their family
They both wanted and for that matter needed what neither one could really handle
They both wanted and for that matter needed what neither one could really handle
Navidson quickly took refuge in his documentary
Regrettably for Karen, his work was still at home
She needed help
Except in those objects housing evidence of her adultery, Karen's affair with Fowler barely exists in The Navidson Record
It was not until the film began to succeed that details concerning this relationship, however spurious, began to emerge
After all, he was consummately attractive, and even more appealing to Karen, he was stupid
This had taken place when Navidson and Karen were still living in New York City, a year before they bought the house in Virginia
Navidson was off taking aerial pictures of barges off the Norwegian coast

Fowler probably never realized how wrong he was
Not only had Navidson carried Karen out of that house, he had picked her up a hundred times over the course of eleven years and carried her fear, her torment and her distance
In a rare moment , Reston called in on a late-night radio show and lambasted the host for promoting such ridiculous gossip: "Let me tell you this, Will Navidson did everything for that woman

He was solid
They were just a means to escape the closeness of any relationship, particularly the one with the man she loved most
It is pretty certain Navidson knew about "the love letters Karen hid in her jewelry box
" 316 But what intrigues many critics these days is the manner in which he chose to regard that curious object
As semiotician Clarence Sweeney wrote:
While Navidson refused to make her infideli
ties a 'public' part of the film, he seemed
sequently he symbolizes her transgressions in the sealed hand-carved ivory case con
taining Karen 's valuables, thus creating a ' private ' aspect to his project, which in tum prompt s yet another reevaluation of the meaning of interiority in The Navidson Re
cord
140, as well as works already mentioned in footnote 15
Also reconsider the moment discussed in Chapter II (pages 10-1 l) where Navidson opens the jewelry box and then moments later throws out some of the hair he has just removed from Karen's brush
318 318No matter whether you're an electrician, scholar or dope addict, chances are that somewhere you've still got a letter, postcard or note that's meaningful to you
350
It is safe to assume Navidson knew Karen better than anyone else
No doubt his knowledge of Fowler, the cache of letters, certainly the discovery of Wax and Karen ' s kiss, contributed to bis decision to return to the house for one more exploration
Which was true
Navidson was no longer around, except of course Karen still saw him every day and in a way she had never seen him before-not as a projection of her own insecurities and demons but just as Will Navidson, in flickering light, flung up by a 16mm projector on a paint-white wall

And then the whole private history explodes
Suddenly a much larger world intrudes on the boyish Navidson
Family portraits are replaced by pictures of tank drivers in Cambodia, peasants hauling empty canisters of nerve gas to the side of the road, children selling soda near body bags smeared with red oil-soaked clay, crowds in Thailand, a murdered man in Israel, the dead in Angola; fractions plucked from the stream, informing the recent decades, sometimes even daring to suggest a whole

The world around only mattered because people lived there and sometimes, in spite of the pain, tragedy, and degradation , even managed to triumph there

Though Karen gives her piece the somewhat faltering title A Brief History Of Who I Love, the use of Navidson 's photos, many of them prize-winning, frequently permits the larger effects of the late 20th century to intrude
Gordon Burke points out the emotional significance of this alignment between personal and cultural pasts:

Each of Navidson's photographs consistently reveals how vehemently he despised life's destruction and how desperately he sought to preserve its fleeting beauties, no matter the circumstances
Karen, however, does not need to point any of this out

The diligence, discipline, and time-consuming research required to fashion this short-there are easily over a hundred edits-allowed Karen for the first time to see Navidson as something other than her own personal fears and projections
She witnessed for herself how much he cherished the human will to persevere
And then quite unexpectedly, she came across the meaning of his privately guarded obsession
While Navidson's work bas many remarkable images of individuals challenging fate, over a third captures the meaning of defeat-those second s after an execution, the charred fingers found in the rubble of a bombed township, or the dull-blue look of eyes which in the final seconds of life could still not muster enough strength to close

Where objective data is concerned, this was all Navidson had to work with
Once he left the house, however, he began to consider new evidence: namely the collected wall samples
Once he left the house, however, he began to consider new evidence: namely the collected wall samples
In lush colour, Navidson captures those time-honored representa
tions of science: test tubes bubbling with boric acid, reams of computer paper bearing the black-ink weight of analysis, electro n microscopes resurrecting universes out of dust, and mass-spectrometers with retractable Faradays and stationary Balzers humming in some dim approximatio n of life
Various instruments promise answers, even guarantees
Still in order to make sure all this apparatus does not come across as too sterile, Navidson also includes shots of the life-support system: a Krups coffee maker hissing and bubbling, an Oasis poster taped to the vending machine, Homer Simpson on the lounge TV saying something to his brother Herbert
As a favor to Reston, petrologist Mel O'Geery, up at the Princeton geology department, has agreed to donate his spare time and oversee the examination of all the wall samples
Prone toward bird like gestures, he is a slight man who takes great delight in speaking very quickly
For nearly four months, he has analyzed every piece of matter, all the way from A (taken a few feet into the first hallway) to XXXX {taken by Navidson when he found himself alone at the bottom of the Spiral Staircase)
It is not an
371
inexpensive undertaking, and while the university has agreed to fund most of it, apparently Navidson also had to throw in a fair amount himself
337
337The actual sum is never made clear in the film
Tena Leeson estimates Navidson's contributions were anywhere from a few hundred dollars to a few thousand

As O'Geery indicates to Navidson, several of the XXXX samples also appear to have ages predating the formation of the earth
(Though the accuracy of those claims remains hotly contested)

It certainly lends weight to those theories favoring the historical significance of the samples, though it does nothing to resolve the presence of extraterrestrial and possibly even interstellar matter

Based on the evidence, sample A thru sample XXXX appear to make up an exact chronological map, which though simple, nevertheless still shows that ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥

Navidson asks

"Nothing peculiar or out of the ordinary
" Navidson presses
O'Geery shakes his head
"Meteors
" Navidson shoots a look at Reston
O'Geery nods, picking up the sample marked VVVV
"
Primarily thanks to O'Geery 's conclusions, some fanatics of The Navidson Record assert that the presence of extremely old cbondrites defmitively proves extra-terrestrial forces constructed the house
Others, however, claim the samples only support the idea that the house on Ash Tree Lane is a self-created portal into some other dimension
In
chapter 13, Keepling credits The Navidson Record with the revival of the Hollow Earth Movement
Tracing this implausible theory from the wobbly ratiocinations of John Cleaves Symmes ( 1779-1829)
objectivity can never adequately address the reality of that place on Ash Tree Lane
Perhaps for us the most significant thing gleaned from this segment is Navidson 's persistent use of all the data353to deny the internal shattering
353See Exhibit Three for all test results, including rubidium-87/strontium-87, potassium-40/argon-40, samarium-147/neodymium-143 dating, as well as a complete set of reports on uranium-235 and -238 contents in lead isotopes
He uses his camera to embrace the Princeton laboratory equipment, seek out the appeasement of numbers, all the while never openly reflecting on the very real absence continuing to penetrate his life
Similar to the way Karen tried to rely on Feng Shui to mitigate the effects of the house, Navidson turns to the time telling tick of radioactive isotopes to deny the darkness eviscerating him from within
Noda Yennard believes the key to this sequence does not exist in any of the test results or geological hypotheses but in the margin of a magazine which, as we can see for ourselves, Navidson idly fills with doodles while waiting for Dr
