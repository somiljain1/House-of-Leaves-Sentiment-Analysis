Navidson had a completely different reaction
He could not stop thinking about those corridors and rooms
As we witness for ourselves, following their meeting with Dr
O'Geery, Navidson and Reston both return home
Reston breaks open a bottle of Jack , pours two three-finger glasses and hand s one to his friend
"
Navidson does not respond
"We can' t do this thing alone
"
Navidson puts his drink down and after a long uncomfortab le silence nods
"Okay , tomorrow morning we' ll call them, we'll send them invita
384
"Here's to opening things up," Navidson says by way of a toast,
then glancing at the photograph of Karen and the children he keeps by the
"
The next morning when Reston woke up, Navidson was gone
He had left behind a note of thanks and an envelope for Karen
A day later he drove to the house
Navidson's car sat in the driveway
Reston wheeled himself to the front door
But as Reston eventually found out the house was empty and most startling of all the hallway that had loomed for so long in the east wall was gone
Why Did Navidson Go Back To The House
A great deal of speculation has gone into determining the exact reason why Navidson chose to reenter the house
Why Did Navidson Go Back To The House
A great deal of speculation has gone into determining the exact reason why Navidson chose to reenter the house
It is a question The Navidson Record never deals with specifically and which after several years of intense debate has produced no simple answer
A great deal of speculation has gone into determining the exact reason why Navidson chose to reenter the house
It is a question The Navidson Record never deals with specifically and which after several years of intense debate has produced no simple answer
Currently there are three schools of thought:
tional Cultural Advancement held in Reykjavik, Iceland, Jennifer Kellog and Isabelle Antwerk presented their paper on the meaning and authority of title in the 20th and 21st century
In their study, they cited Navidson as the perfect example of "one dictated by the logic born out of the need to posses s
"
"
Kellog and Antwerk point out how even though Navidson and Karen own the house together (both their names appear on the mortgage), Navidson frequently implies that he is the sole proprietor
As he soaps at Reston during a heated argument on the subject of future explorations: "Let' s not forget that' s my hou se
As he soaps at Reston during a heated argument on the subject of future explorations: "Let' s not forget that' s my hou se
" Kellog and Antwerk regard this possessivenes s as the main reason for Navidson's mind-boggling decision
358While bits and pieces of these readings still circulate, they have yet to appear anywhere in their entirety
to enter the house alone
A month later Norman Paarlberg wryly offered up the following response to the Reykjavik duo: "The obsession just grew and grew until it was Navidson who was finally possessed by some self
destructive notion to go back there and yet completely disposses sed of any rational mechanism to override such an incredibly stupid idea
Kellog and Antwerk argue that the act of returning was an attempt to territorialize and thus preside over that virtually unfathomable space
However, if their claim is correct that Navidson's preoccupation with the house grew solely out of his need to own it, then other behavioral patterns should have followed suit, which was not the case
For instance, Navidson never sought to buy out Karen's share of their home
However, if their claim is correct that Navidson's preoccupation with the house grew solely out of his need to own it, then other behavioral patterns should have followed suit, which was not the case
For instance, Navidson never sought to buy out Karen's share of their home
He refused to lure television programs and other corporate sponsors to his doorstep which would have further enforced his titular position, at least in the eye of the media
Nor did he ever invest himself in any kind paper writing, lectures, or other acts of publicity
And even if Navidson did mentally equate ownership with knowl
edge, as both Kellog and Antwerk assert he did, he should have more adamantly sought to name the aspects of his discoveries, which as others would later observe he most certainly did not
The BFJ Criteria defined ownership as an act of verbal assertion necessarily carried out in public
By refusing to acknowledge The Navidson Record as such an act, The BFJ Criteria could make the question of personal necessity the salient point for rhetorical negotiation
For the first half of its discourse, The BFJ Criteria chose to concen
trate on guilt and grief
Careful consideration was given to Navidson's excessive exposure to traumatic events throughout the world and how he was affected by witnessing scores of "life-snaps" (The language of The Criteria)
Ironically enough, however, it was not until he resigned from those assignments and moved to Ash Tree Lane that death crossed over the threshold and began to roam the halls of his own home
His twin brother died there along with two others whom he had personally welcomed into the house
Losing Tom nearly destroyed Navidson
A fundamental part of himself and his past had suddenly vanished
Even worse, as The BFJ Criteria emphasizes, in the final moments of his life, Tom displayed characteristics entirely atypical of his day to day behavior
Navidson saw his brother in a completely different light
Not at all sluggish or even
remotely afraid, Tom had acted with determination and above all else heroism, carrying Daisy out of harm's way before falling to his death
Navidson cannot forgive himself
As he repeatedly tells Karen over the phone: "I was my brother's keeper
The most controversial claim made by The Bister-Frieden
Josephson contingency is that Navidson began believing darkness could offer something other than itself
Quite cleverly The Criteria first lays the groundwork for its argument by recalling the now famous admonition voiced by Louis Merplat, the renowned speleologist who back in 1899 discovered the Blue Skia Cavern: "Darkness is impossible to remember
"362
The point of recounting these observations is simply to show how understandable it was that for Navidson the impenetrable sweep of that place soon acquired greater meaning simply because, to quote the Criteria directly, "it was full of unheimliche vorklanger363 and thus represented a means to his own personal propitiation
" The sharp-bladed tactics of The BFJCriteria, however, are not so naive as to suddenly embrace Navidson's stated convictions about what he might find

indicting tangle" within Navidson suddenly "lit up," producing projections powerful and painful enough to "occlude, deny, and cover" the only reason for their success in the first place: the blankness of that place, "the utter and perfect blankness
"
It is nevertheless the underlying position of The Bister-Frieden
Josephson Criteria that Navidson in fact relied on such projections in order to deny his increasingly more "powerful and motivating Thanatos
" In the end, he sought nothing less than to see the house exact its annihilating effects on his own being
" In the end, he sought nothing less than to see the house exact its annihilating effects on his own being
Again quoting directly from The Criteria: "Navidson has one deeply acquired organizing perception: there is no hope of survival there
Life is impossible

669, in which she describes her own addiction to The Navidson Record: "I never shook the feeling that the film, while visceral and involving, must pale in comparison to an actual, personal exploration of the house
Still, just as Navidson needed more and more of that endless dark, I too found myself feeling the same way about The Navidson Record

Still, just as Navidson needed more and more of that endless dark, I too found myself feeling the same way about The Navidson Record
In fact as I write this now, I've already seen the film thirty-eight times and have no reason to believe I will stop going to see it
"
The second half of The Bister-Frieden-Josephson Criteria focuses almost entirely on this question of "desire to live" by analyzing in great detail the contents of Navidson's letter to Karen written the night before his departure
To emphasize the potential "desire" for self-destruction, The Criteria supplies for this section the following epigraph:
Thus emphasizing the potentially mortal price for beholding what must lie forever lost in those inky folds
Here The Criteria also points out how Navidson' s previous trespasses, with one exception, were structured around extremely concrete objectives: (1) rescuing the Holloway team; and after sinking down the Staircase (2) returning home
The exception, of course, is the very first visit, where Navidson seeks nothing else but to explore the house, an act which nearly costs him his life

The exception, of course, is the very first visit, where Navidson seeks nothing else but to explore the house, an act which nearly costs him his life
Oddly enough, The Criteria does not acknowledge the risk inherent in (1) and (2)-objective or no objective
Nor does it explain why one trespass/journey should suddenly be treated as two
Because The Bister-Frieden-Josephson Criteria then goes on to treat Navidson's letter in great detail and since its appearance in the film is limited to only a few seconds of screen time, it seems advisable, before further commentary, to reproduce a facsimile here:

The Bister-Frieden-Josephson Criteria pays a great deal of attention to the incoherence present in the letter, the dissatisfaction with the self, and most of all the pain Navidson still feels over the image he burned into the retina of America almost two decades ago
As was already mentioned in Chapter II, before the release of The Navidson Record neither friends nor family nor colleagues knew that Delial was the name Navidso n had given to the starving Sudanese child

For reason s of his own, he never revealed Delial's identity to anyone, not even to Karen

The Navidson Record solved a great mystery when it included Karen 's shot of the name written on the back of the print as well as Navidson 's letter
For years photojournali sts and friends had wondered who Delial was and why she meant so much to Navidson

Quite a few colleagues accused Navidson of being enigmatic on purpose and so out of spite let the subject drop
Few were disappointed when they learned that Delial referred to the subject of his Pulitzer Prize-winning photograph
And he paid the price too
"369 Lind say Gerknard comme nted, "Navidson ran straight into the brick wall all great photojournalists inevitably run into: why aren't I doing something about this instead of just photographing it
And when you ask that question, you hurt
" 371
Nor did evaluations of Navidson 's burden stop with comme nts made by his associates
Academia soon marched in to interrogate the literary consequence s created by the Delial revelation
Tokiko Dudek comme nted on how "Delia] is to Navidso n what the albatross is to Coleridge' s mariner
In both cases, both men shot their mark only to be haunted by the accomplishme nt, even though Navidson did not actually kill Delia

safety in loss
"373 However unlike Dante, Navidson never encountered his Beatrice again

wood creation, Delial would have appeared at the heart of the house
Like something out of Lost Horizon, dark fields would have given way to Elysian fields, the perfect setting for a musical number with a brightly costumed Delial front and center, drinking Shirley Temples, swinging on the arms of Tom and Jed, backed by a chorus line which would have included Holloway and everyone else in Navidson's life (and our life for that matter) who had ever died
Plenty of rootbeer and summer love375 to go around
376
But The Navidson Record is not a Hollywood creation and through the course of the film Delial appears only once, in Karen 's piece, bordered in black, frozen in place without music or commentary, just Delial: a memory, a photograph, an artifact
To this day the treatment of Delial by The Bister-Frieden-Josephson Criteria is still considered harsh and particularly insensate toward international tragedy
To this day the treatment of Delial by The Bister-Frieden-Josephson Criteria is still considered harsh and particularly insensate toward international tragedy
While Navidson's empathy for the child is not entirely disregarded, The Criteria asserts that she soon exceeded the meaning of her own existence: "Memory, experience, and time turned her bones into a trope for everything Navidson had ever lost
"
"
The BFJ Criteria posits that Delial's prominence in Navidson's last letter is a repressive mechanism enabling him to at least on a symbolic level deal with his nearly inexpressible loss
After all in a very short amount of time Navidson had seen the rape of physics

After all in a very short amount of time Navidson had seen the rape of physics
He had watched one man murder another and then pull the trigger on himself
" His invocation of the memory of the members of the first team as well as others sounds almost like a protracted good-bye
Navidson is tying up loose ends and the reason, or so The BFJ Criteria claims , can be detected in the way he treats the Sudanese girl still haunting his past: "It is no coincidence that as Navidson begins to dwell on Delial he mentions his brother three times: 'I had no one to pass her to
There was no window to pass her through out of harms way
45
374During Exploration #5 Navidson had no illusion about what he would find there
While staring into
" 377
Thus The Bister-Frieden-Josephson Criteria staunchly refutes The Kellog-Antwerk Claim by reiterating its argument that Navidson's return to the house was not at all motivated by the need to possess it but rather "to be obliterated by it
"
Slocum Theory proposed to first focus primarily on "the house itself and its generation of physiological effects
" How this direction would resolve the question of "why Navidson returned to the house alone" they promised to show in due course
Relying on an array of personal interviews, closely inspected secondary sources, and their own observations, the married couple began to carefully adumbrate their findings in what has since become known as The Haven-Slocum Anxiety Scale or more simply as PEER
ttt
10: Will Navidson: obsessive behavior; weight loss; night ter
rors; vivid dreaming accompanied by increased mutism
396
The Haven-Slocum Theory does not lightly pass over Karen's remarkable victory over the effects of the house: "With the eventual exception of Navidson, she was the only one who attempted to process the ramifications of that place
The labor she put into both film shorts resulted in more moderate mood swings, an increase in sleep, and an end to that nettlesome coug h
"
Navidson, however, despite his scientific inquiries and early postulations, finds no relief
He grows quieter and quieter, often wakes up seized by terror, and through Christmas and the New Year starts eating less and less
The house continues to fix his attention
So much so that back in October when Navidson first came across the tape of Wax kissing Karen he hardly responded
He viewed the scene twice, once at regular speed, the second time on fast forward, and then moved on to the rest of the footage without saying a word
He viewed the scene twice, once at regular speed, the second time on fast forward, and then moved on to the rest of the footage without saying a word
From a dramatic point of view we must realize it is a highly anticlimactic moment, but one which, as The Haven-Slocum Theory argues, only serves to further emphasize the level of damage the house had already inflicted upon Navidson: "Normal emotional reactions no longer apply
The pain anyone else would have felt while viewing that screen kiss, in Navidson's case has been blunted by the gros sly disproportionate trauma already caused by the house

In this regard it is in fact a highly climactic, if irregular moment, only because it is so disturbing to watch something so typically meaningful rendered so utterly inconsequential
How tragic to find Navidson so bereft of energy, his usual snap and alacrity of thought replaced by such unyielding torpor
Nothing matters anymore to him, which as more than a handful of people have already observed, is precisely the point
"
Then at the beginning of March, "while tests on the wall samples progre ssed," as The Haven -Slocum Theory observes, Navidson begins to eat again, work out, and though his general reticence continues, Reston still sees Navidson 's new behavior as a change for the better: "I was blind to his intentions
I thought he was starting to deal with Tom 's death, planning to end his separation with Karen
"378
Where The Bister-Frieden-Jo sephson Criteria made Navidson's Jetter to Karen the keystone of its analysis, The Haven-Slocum Theory does away with the document in a footnote, describing it as "drunken babble chock-ful1 of expected expressio ns of grief, re-identification with a lost object, and plenty of transference, having less to do with Navidson 's lost brother and more to do with the maternal absence he endured throughout his life
The desire to save Delia
The desire to save Delia
must partly be attributed to a projection of Navidson's own desire to be cradled by his mother
Therefore his grief fuses his sense of self with his understanding of the other, causing him not only to mourn for the tiny child but for himself as well
397
What The Haven-Slocum Theory treats with greater regard are the three dreams380 Navidson described for us in the Hi 8 journal entries he made that March
Again quoting directly from the Theory: "Far better than words influenced by the depressive effects of alcohol, these intimate glimpses of Navidson's psyche reveal more about why he decided to go back and what may account for the profound physiological consequences that followed once he was inside

"
" Unfortunately, as her treatment is difficult to find and purportedly exceeds 180 pages, it is only possible to summarize the contents here
As Haven recounts, Navidson 's first dream places him within an enormous concrete chamber
The walls, ceiling, and floor are all veined with mineral deposits and covered in a thin ever-present film of moisture
A dozen people sit on the edge, dangling their feet inside
As Navidson approaches this aperture, he realizes two things: I) he has died and this is some kind of half-way station, and 2) the only way out is down through the well
As he sits on the edge, he beholds a strange and very disconcerting sight
No more than twenty feet below is the surface of an incredibly clear liquid
Navidson presumes it is water though he senses it is somewhat more viscous
By some peculiar quality intrinsic to itself, this liquid does not impede but actually clarifies the impossible vision of what lies beneath: a long shaft descending for miles ultimately opening up into a black bottomless pit which instantly fills Navidson with an almost crippling sense of dread

Suddenly next to him, someone leaps into the well
Fortunately after a few seconds, a violent blue light envelops the figure and transports it somewhere else
Navidson realizes, however, that there are other figures down there who have not been visited by that blue light and are instead writhing in fear as they continue their descent into oblivion
Without anyone telling him, Navidson somehow understands the logic of the place: 1) he can remain in that awful room for as long as he likes, even forever if he chooses-looking around, he can tell that some people have been there for thousands of years-o r he can jump into the

If, however, he has lived an "inappropriate life," (Navidson's words) no light will visit him and he will sink into the horrible blackness below where he will fall forever

The concrete chamber resembles the ashen walls, while the bottomless pit recalls both the Spiral Staircase and the abyss that appeared in his living room the night Tom died
Still what matters most is not some discovery made within those walls but rather within himself
In Haven's words: "The dream seems to suggest that in order for Navidson to properly escape the house he must first reach an understanding about his own life, one he still quite obviously lacks
"
" Since his piece, like Haven's, is also impossible to locate and reportedly well over two hundred pages long, summary will again have to suffice
Slocum retells how in the second dream Navidson finds himself in the centre of a strange town where some sort of feast is in progress
The smell of garlic and beer haunts the air
The smell of garlic and beer haunts the air
Everyone is eating and drinking and Navidson understands that for some undisclosed reason they will now have enough food to last many decades
When the feast finally comes to an end, everyone grabs a candle and begins to march out of the town
When the feast finally comes to an end, everyone grabs a candle and begins to march out of the town
Navidson follows and soon discovers that they are heading for a the hill on which lies the shell of an immense snail
This sight brings with it a new understanding: the town has slain the creature, eaten some of it and preserved the rest
As they enter the enormous wind (as in "to wind something up "), their candlelight illuminates walls that are white as pearl and as opalescent as sea shells
Laughter and joy echoes up the twisting path and Navidson recognizes that everyone has come there to honor and thank the snail
Navidson, however, keeps climbing up through the shell
Laughter and joy echoes up the twisting path and Navidson recognizes that everyone has come there to honor and thank the snail

Soon he is alone and as the passageway continues to get tighter and tighter, the candle he holds grows smaller and smaller
upon the imagination of countless poets and even entire cultures

For example, Slocum views the question of Navidson's personal growth in tenns of the enigma posed by the snail before it was eventually solved
Here he quotes from the translated Bachelard text:
400
In particular, Slocum's attention is held by Bachelard's parentethical384 reference to his own childhood and presumably the rite of growing up: "How extraordinary to find in those ever expandable brackets such a telling correlation between the answer to the Sphinx's riddle and Navidson's crisis
"
"
Indeed, by continuing to build on Bachelard, Slocum treats the snail in Navidson's dream as a "remarkable inversion" of the house's Spiral Staircase: "Robinet believed that it was by rolling over and over that the snail built its 'staircase
' Thus, the snail's entire house would be a stair
387
Navidson is not the first to envision a snail as large as a village, but what fascinates Slocum more than anything else is the lack of threat in the dream
"Unlike the dread lying in wait at the bottom of the wishing well," Slocum comments
"The snail provides nourishment
Its shell offers the redemption of beauty, and despite Navidson's dying candle, its curves still hold out the promise of even greater illumination
All of which is in stark contrast to the house
"
Slocum contends that the dream planted the seed in Navidson's mind to try a different path, which was exactly what he did do in Exploration #5
Or more accurately:" The dream was the flowering of a seed previously planted by the house in his unconsciousness
Or more accurately:" The dream was the flowering of a seed previously planted by the house in his unconsciousness
" When bringing to a conclusion "At A Snail's Place," Slocum further opens up his analysis to the notion that both dreams, "The Wishing Well" and "The Snail," suggested to Navidson the possibility that he could locate either within himself or" within that vast missing" some emancipatory sense to put to rest his confusions and troubles, even put to rest the confusions and troubles of others, a curative symmetry to last the ages
For the more troubling and by far most terrifying Dream #3, Mia Haven and Lance Slocum team up together to ply the curvatures of that strange stretch of imaginings
tory filled my imagination and dreams when I was a boy
I cannot recall how many times I read and re-read the story of Jonah, and now as I dwell on Navidson's decision to return to the house alone I tum to my Bible and find among those thin pages these lines:
So they took up Jonah, and cast him forth into the sea: and the sea ceased from her raging
(Jonah I: I 5)392
It seems a somewhat bizarre reference, until Haven and Slocum produce a second PEER table documenting what happened once Navidson entered the house on Ash Tree Lane:

Perhaps strangest of all, the consequences of Navidson's journey are still being felt today
In what remains the most controversial aspect of The Haven-Slocum Theory, the concluding paragraphs claim that people not even directly associated with the events on Ash Tree Lane have been affected
In what remains the most controversial aspect of The Haven-Slocum Theory, the concluding paragraphs claim that people not even directly associated with the events on Ash Tree Lane have been affected
The Theory, however, is careful to distinguish between those who have merely seen The Navidson Record and those who have read and written, in some cases extensively, about the film
Apparently, the former group shows very little evidence of any sort of emotional or mental change:" At most, temporary
However, The Haven-Slocum Theory also points out that this course is not without risk
An even greater number of people dwelling on The Navidson Record have shown an increase in obsessiveness, insomnia, and incoherence: "Most of those who chose to abandon their interest soon recovered
A few, however, required counseling and in some instances medication and hospitalization
"
Though Karen and Navidson both went back to Ash Tree Lane, Karen did not go there for the house
As she explains in a video entry: "I' m going because of Navy
During the first week of April, she stayed in close contact with Reston who made the long drive from Charlottesville more than a few times
As we can see for ourselves, Navidson's car never moves from the driveway and the house continues to remain empty
In the living room a closet still stands in place of the hallway, while upstairs the space between the master bedroom and the children's bedroom is lost to a wall
At the start of the second week of April, Karen realizes she will have to leave New York
Daisy and Chad seem to have shaken off the debilitating effects of the house and their grandmother is more than happy to look after them while Karen is gone, believing her daughter's trip will take her one step closer toward selling the house and suing Navidson
On April 9th,Karen heads south to Virginia
"
It is not surprising The Navidson Record does not pause to consider this reference, especially considering that Karen is far more concerned about the house and Navidson' s whereabouts than she is with 17th century history
However having some familiarity with the bloody and painful origins of that particular toe hold in the new world reveals just how old the roots of that house really are
In 1995, parapsychologist Lucinda S
Hausmaninger claimed that Navidson's place was analogous to the blind spot created by the optic nerve in the retina: "It is a place of processing, of sense-making, of seeing
"40 2 However, she soon altered this supposition, describing it as "the omphalos of all we are
405
As everyone knows, instead of delving into the question of location or the history of the Jamestown Colony, The Navidson Record focuses on Alicia Rosenbaum in her dingy little office talking to Karen about her troubles
It may very well be the best response of all: tea, comfort, and social intercourse
Perhaps Rosenbaum's conclusion is even the best: "lord knows why but no one ever seems comfortab le staying there," as if to imply in a larger way that there are some places in this world which no one will ever possess or inhabit
Karen may hate the house but she needs Navidson
When the video tape flickers back to life, it is 9:30 P
Karen actually laughs but her laughter comes up short
Her only hope of finding Navidson had been to confront what terrified her most
Now without a reason to be afraid, Karen suddenly finds herself without a reason to hope
After spending the first few nights at the Days Inn, Karen decides to move back into the house
Reston visits her periodically, and each time he comes they go over every alcove and corner looking for some sign of Navidson
They never find anything
As she has turned back on all the wall mounted Hi 8s and kept them resupplied with fresh tapes, there is ample footage of her hard at work at this task, filling page after page, just as she sometimes fills the house with peals of laughter or now and then the broken notes of a cry
Though she eventually uses up the entire volume, not one word is ever visible in The Navidson Record
To this day the contents of her journal remain a mystery
"
But a few hours after Reston leaves, Karen smiles again, apparently catching somewhere inside her the faint voice of Navidson
This happens over and over again, whether late at night or in the middle of the day
Sometimes Karen calls out to him, sometimes she just wanders from room to room, pushing her ear against walls or floors
Then on the afternoon of May IOtfi, she finds in the children's bedroom, born out of nowhere, Navidson's clothes, remnants of his pack and sleeping bag, and scattered across the floor, from comer to comer, cartridges of fihn, boxes of 16mm, and easily a dozen video tapes
She immediately calls Reston and tells him what has happened, asking him to drive over as soon as he can
On Photography
"Nothing of consequence" was how Navidson described the
quality of the film and tapes rescued from the house
In the eyes of many, the footage from Exploration A offered an exemplary first-look at what lay down the hallway
To Navidson, however, the venture was spoiled by the limited resolution of the Hi 8 and "rid iculous lighting
" Film taken during Exploration #4 was much more successful in capturing the size of that place, though due to the urgency of the mission Navidson only had time for a few shots
