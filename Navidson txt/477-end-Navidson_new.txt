Until Exploration #5 there was never a true visual meditation on the house itself, its terrifying proportions and the palpable darkness inhabiting it
The few fragments of usable 16mm and video tape incensed Navidson
In his opinion, very few of the images-even those he was personally responsible for-retained any of those fantastic dimensions intrinsic to that place
In his opinion, very few of the images-even those he was personally responsible for-retained any of those fantastic dimensions intrinsic to that place
All of which begins to explain why in February and March Navidson began to order high speed film, magnesium flares, powerful flashes, and even arranged to rent a thermal video camera
He intentionally kept Reston in the dark, assuming his friend would try to stop him or endanger himself by insisting on going along
418
Throughout his career, Navidson had almost without exception worked alone
He was used to entering areas of conflict by himself
Thuan once said:
Will Navidson is one of this century's finest photographers, but because his work defines him as a "photojournalist" he suffers to this day that most lamentable of critical denuncia
tions: "Hey, he just shoots what happens
411
Only very recently has the detection of a formidable understanding and use of frame balance inherent in all of Navidson's work begun to breach the bias against his profession
Consider for the last time the image that won him the Pulitzer Prize

Not even taking into account the courage necessary to travel to Sudan, walk the violent, disease-infested streets, and finally discover this child on some rocky patch of earth-all of which some consider a major part of photography and even art412 -Navidson also had to contend with the

Or as associate UCLA professor Rudy Snyder speculated: "We would be turned into an impartial audience plunked down in front of history's glass covered proscenium

Leffler reacquainted himself with Navidson's picture in a recent retrospective, he wistfully commented:
It seems people should complain more about this empty space but to my knowl-
4 14
Leffler's point is simply that while Navidson does not physically appear in the frame he still occupies the right side of the photograph
The emptiness there is merely a gnomonic representation of both his presence and influence, challenging the predator for a helpless prize epitomized by the flightless wings of a dying child 's shoulder blades
is not exactly in the centre
She is closer to Navidson, and hence to the observer, by a hair
Many experts attribute this slight imbalance to the large outpouring of national support and the creation of several relief programs which followed the publication of the photograph
Cafiso maintained back in 1985:
Navidson's all consuming interest in people-and usually people caught in ter
rible circumstances-always puts him in direct conflict with death
4 17
As previously mentioned in Chapter XV, Navidson never photographed scenery, but he also never photographed the threat of death without interposing someone else between himself and it
Returning to Ash Tree Lane meant removing the other
Interestingly enough in one of his early footnotes, Cafiso broaches a troubling but highly provocative aesthetic concern when he observes how even "the finest act of seeing is necessarily always the act of llQl seeing something else
" Regrettably he takes this matter no further nor applies it later on to the photographic challenges Navidson ultimately had to face

Onthe first day of April, Navidson set out on the last exploration of those strange hallways and rooms
The card introduces this sequence as nothing more than Exploration #5

For recording the adventure, Navidson brought with him a 1962 Hl6 hand crank Bolex 16mm camera along with 16mm, 25mm, 75mm Kern-Paillard lenses and a Bogen tripod
He also carried a Sony microcas
Unfortunately the thermal video camera he had arranged to rent fell through in the last minute
For survival gear, Navidson took with him a rated sleeping bag , a one man tent , ration s for two weeks, 2 five-gallon containers of water, chemical heat packs, flares, high intensity as well as regular inten sity lightsticks, plenty of neon markers, fishing line, three flashlights, one small pumper light, extra batteries, a carbide lamp, matches, toothbrush, stove, change of clothes, an extra sweater, extra socks, toilet paper, a small medical kit, and one book
All of which he carefuJly loaded into a two wheel trailer which he secured to an aluminum-frame mountain bike
He also installed an odometer
As we can see, when Navidson first starts down the hall
way he does not head for the Spiral Staircase
" When he finally stops for the night , the odometer reads an incredible 163 miles
As he sets up camp in a small room, Navidson already knows his
trip is over: "After going downhill for eight hours at nearly 20 mph , it will probably take me six to seven days, maybe more, to get back to where I started from
"
When Navidson wakes up the next morning, he eats a quick breakfast , point s the bike home, and begins what he expects will be an appalling, perhaps impossible, effort
However within a few minutes, he finds he no longer needs to peda l
"
Resigned to his fate, Navidson climbs back on the bike and soon enough finds himself clipping along at almost thirty miles an hour
For the next five days Navidson covers anywhere from 240 to 300 miles at a time, though on the fifth day, in what amounts to an absurd fourteen hour marathon , Navidson logs 428 miles

As the days pass, Navidson becomes more and more aware that he is running precariously low on water and food
Even worse, the sense of inevitable doom this causes him is compo unded by the sense of immediate doom he feels whenever he begins riding his bike: "I can't help thinking I'm going to reach an edge to this thing

After changing the bandages on his leg and devouring a small snack, Navidson transfers the sleeping bag, tent, Bolex, the Nikon, the Hi 8, the film, all the video tapes, the microcassette recorder, two containers of water, three flares, chemical heaters, and the remaining PowerBars into his pack, which he then tosses up through the hole

Hans Staker from Geneva, Switzerland has researched the Navidson-match question
By carefully analyzing one black & white print which briefly appears after the flare vignettes, Staker managed to magnify the matchbook just visible in the lower left hand corner

Navidson's thumb obscures most of the design but the Latin words Fuit Ilium can still be made out along with the English words Thanks To These Puppies
Based on this scant evidence, Staker successfully determined that the matches came from of all places a pub outside of Oxford, England, run by a former classics pro

Staker goes on to trace how the matchbook got from Learned's pub to Navidson's steady hands

Even if Navidson can average a page a minute, he will still come up 704 pages short (he had already read 26 pages)
To over
Unfortunately Staker's calculations are really more a form of academic onanism, a jerk of numeric wishful thinking, having very little to do with the real world
As Navidson reports , he soon begins falling behind
Perhaps his reading slows or the paper burns unevenly or he has bungled the lighting of the next page
Or maybe the words in the book have been arranged in such a way as to make them practically impossible to read
Whatever the reason, Navidson is forced to light the cover of the book as well as the spine
He tries to read faster, inevitably loses some of the text, frequently burns his fingers

In the end Navidson is left with one page and one match
For a long time he waits in darkness and cold, post
Here then is one end: a final act of reading , a final act of consumption
And as the fire rapidly devours the paper, Navidson's eyes frantically sweep down over the text, keep
ing ju st ahead of the necessary immolation , until as he reaches the last few words, flames lick around his hand s, ash peels off into the surrounding emptiness, and then as the fire retreats, dimming, its light suddenly spent, the book is gone leaving nothing behind but invisible traces already dismantled in the dark

After all, the film does not provide an even remotely coherent synthesis of Navidson's fall

All of which comes down to one incredible fact: nearly six minutes of screen time is black

He was so shocked , indignant , even incoherent , he failed to consider that The Navidson Record might have absolutely nothing to do with cinema

Everywhere I've gone, there've been hints of Zampano's history, by which I mean Navidson's, without any real evidence to confirm any of it
I've combed through all the streets and fields from Disputanta to Five Forks to as far east as the Isle of Wight, and though I frequently feel close, real close, to something important, in the end I come away with nothing

As everyone knows, Karen stands there on the brink for several minutes, pointing her flashlight into the darkness and calling out for Navidson
421 When she finally does step inside, she takes no deep breath and makes no announcement
Except in Tartt 's version, instead of stepping into darkness, Karen returns to New York and marries a wealthy magazine publisher

Whatever ultimately allows Karen to overcome her fears, there is little doubt her love for Navidson is the primary catalyst

By relearning to see Navidson, she saw what he wasn't and consequently began to see herself much more clearly

Navidson was no different

Regardless of what finally enabled her to walk across that threshold, forty-nine minutes later a neighbor saw Karen crying on the front lawn, a pink ribbon in her hair, Navidson cradled in her lap
An ambulance soon arrived
Reston caught up with them at the hospital
Navidson's core temperature had dropped to a frighteningly low
83
7 degrees Fahrenheit
Lacking a cardiopulmonary bypass machine which could have pumped out Navidson's cold blood and replaced it with warm oxygenated blood, doctors instead had to cut into Navidson's abdominal cavity, insert catheters, and proceed to irrigate his internal organs with warm fluid
Though his core temperature rose to 85
Karen stayed at his side that night and through the nights and days which followed, reading to him, singing to him, and when she was tired sleeping on the floor by his bed
As hours slipped into weeks, Navidson began to recover, but the price he paid for living was not cheap
Frostbite claimed his right hand and clipped the top portion of one ear

Both Karen and Will Navidson survive their ordeal and they do exchange conjugal vows in Vermont
Of course, is it really possible to look at Navidson 's ravaged face, the patch covering his left eye, the absence of a hand, the crutch wedged under his armpit, and call it a "happy " ending

Still, as Navidson tenderly
shows us, her will-o'-the-wisp smiles seem impervious to the ravaging
effects of disease and whenever she laughs the notes sing a call to Victory
Navidson captures all this in simple, warmly lit shots: simmering milk, roasted walnuts and against a backdrop of black ash and pine, Karen's graceful fingers braiding her daughter's long auburn hair
Despite Karen' s infrequently removed woolen hat, she and Daisy still both share a remarkable radiance
graphs hang on the walls of their home
Every room, stairway, and corridor supports pictures of Karen, Daisy, Chad, and Navidson as well as Tom, Reston, Karen's mother, their friends, distant relatives, ancient relatives, even Mallory and Hillary
Though this collage is immensely appealing, Nav idson is wise enough to know he cannot close on such images
They may be heart warming but what they imply rings false
As Navidson says himself: "I kept
looking for assurances, for that gentle ending, but I never found it Maybe because I know that place is still there
