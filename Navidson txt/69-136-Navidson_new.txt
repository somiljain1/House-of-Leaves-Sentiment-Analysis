Unfortunately the living room Hi 8 cannot follow him nor for that matter can Karen
Fortunately, she does not have to wait too long
Navidson soon reappears with Chad and Daisy in each arm, both of them still clutching a homemade candle, their faces lit like sprites on a winter's eve
This is the first sign of Karen's chronic disability
Up until now there has never been even the slightest indication that she suffers from crippling claustrophobia
By the time Navidson and the two children are safe and sound in the living room, Karen is drenched in sweat
She hug s and holds them as if they had just narrowly avoided some terrible fate, even though neither Chad nor Daisy seems particularly disturbed by their little adventure
they want to go back
Perhaps because of Karen 's evident distress, Navidson agrees to at least temporarily make this new addition to their house off limits
For the rest of the night, Karen keeps a tight grip on Navidson

absolute need for him, so markedly different from her frequently aloof posture, Navidson cradles her in bis arms like a child and promi ses
Since the release of The Navidson Record, Virginia Posah has written extensively about Karen Green's adolescent years
Posah' s thin volume entitled Wishing Well (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 1996) represents one of the few works which while based on the Navidsoos' experience still manage s to stand on its own merits outside of the film
Though Posah goes on to discuss the cultural aspects and consequences of beauty, these details in particular are most disturbing, especially in light of the fact that little of their history appears in the film
Considering the substantial coverage present in The Navidson Record, it is unsettling to discover such a glaring omission
In spite of the enormous quantity of home footage obviously available, for some reason calamities of the past still do not appear
In spite of the enormous quantity of home footage obviously available, for some reason calamities of the past still do not appear
Clearly Karen's personal life, to say nothing of his own life, caused Navidson too much anxiety to portray either one particularly well in his film
Rather than delve into the pathology

of Karen's claustrophobia, Navidson chose instead to focus strictly on the house
69
She does not seem to care when they discover the hallway has not vanished
She keeps her arms folded, no longer clinging to Navidson's hand or stroking her children
69Fortunately a few years before The Navidson Record was made Karen took part in a study which promised to evaluate and possibly treat her fear

After the film became something of a phenomenon, those results surfaced and were eventually published in a number of periodicals
D
observes that "Karen's attacks, which I suspect stem from early adolescent betrayal, increase proportionally with the level of intimacy-or even the threat of potential intimacy-she experiences whether with Will Navidson or even her children
"
Karen 's smile is tragic because, in spite of its meaning, it succeeds in remaining so utterly beautiful
The Five and a Half Minute Hallway in The Navidson Record differs slightly from the bootleg copy which appeared in 1990
For one thing, in addition to the continuous circumambulating shot, a wider selection of shots has made the coverage of the sequence much more thorough and fluid
Context also significantly alters "The Five and a Half Minute Hallway
" A greater sense of the Navidsons and their friends and how they all interact with the house adds the greatest amount of depth to this quietly evolving enigma
Their personalities almost crowd that place and suddenly too, as an abrupt jump cut redelivers Tom from Massachusetts and Billy Reston from Charlottesville, the UV A professor once again wheeling around the periphery of the angle, unable to take his eyes off the strange, dark corridor
71 Similarly the hallway also remains meaningless, though it is most assuredly not without effect
As Navidson threatens to reenter it for a closer inspection, Karen reiterates her previous plea and injunction with a sharp and abrupt rise in pitch
The ensuing tension is more than temporary
The ensuing tension is more than temporary
Navidson has always been an adventurer willing to risk his personal safety in the name of achievement Karen, on the other hand, remains the standard bearer of responsibility and is categorically against risks especially those which might endanger her family or her happiness
Tom also shies from danger, preferring to tum over a problem to someone else, ideally a police officer, fireman, or other state paid official

Without sound or movement but by presence alone, the hallway creates a serious rift in the Navidson household
Bazine Naodook suggests that the hallway exudes a "conflict creating force": "It' s those oily walls radiating badness which maneuver Karen and Will into that nonsensical fight
Somehow, and for whatever reason, the thing has grown again
Intermittently, Navidson opens the door himself and stares down the
hallway, sometimes using a flashlight, sometimes just studying the
"What do you do with that
" Navidson asks his brother one eve
ning
"Move," Tom replies
Sadly, even with the unnatural darkness now locked behind a steel door, Karen and Navidson still continue to say very little to each other, their own feelings seemingly as impossible for them to address as the meaning of the hallway itself
61
Chad accompanies his mother to town as she searc hes for various Feng Shui objects guaranteed to change the energy of the home, while Daisy follows her father around the house as he paces from room to room, talking vehemently on the phone with Reston, trying to come up with a feasible and acceptable way to investigate the phenomenon lurking in his living room, until finally, in the middle of all this, he lifts his daughter onto his shoulder s
Unfortunately as soon as Karen returns, Navidson sets Daisy back down on the floor and retreats to the study to continue his discussions alone
With domestic tensions proving a little too much to stomach, Tom escapes to the garage where he works for a while on a doll house he has started to build for Daisy,73 until eventually he takes a break, drifting out to the backyard to get high and hot in the sun, pointedly walking around the patch of lawn the hallway should for all intents and purpose s occupy
He almost seems to enjoy their mischief, growling , yawning, playing along, putting both of them in a headlock, Chad and Daisy laughing hysterically, until finally all three are exhausted and snoozing into dusk
Considering the complexity of Karen and Navidson's relationship, it is fortunate our under stand ing of their problems is not left entirely up to interpretation
Some of their respective views and feelings are revealed in their video journal entries
"
On the same subject, Navidson offers a similar view: "When we first moved here, Karen was like a college co-ed
Anywhere, anytime
"
Navidson: "The only thing I want to do is go in there but she's
adamant that I don't and I love her so I won't but, well, it's ju st killing me
87
'¥Nor does it seem to help that Navidson and Karen both have among their books Erica Jong's Fear of Flying (New York: Holt, Rinehart & Winston, 1973), Anne Hooper's The Ultimate Sex Book : A Therapist 's Guide to the Programs and Techniques Thar Will Enhance Your Relationship and Transform Your Life (DK Publishing, 1992), X

" "Don't you dare, Navy
" Karen immediately cries
"Come on Karen, they're our friends," Navidson says, leading the two celebrities into the living room where he instructs them to look out the window so they can see for themselves his ordinary backyard
Satisfied that they understand nothing but trees and lawn could possibly lie on the other side of the wall, he retrieves the four coloured keys hidden in the antique basinet in the foyer
Everyone is pretty tipsy and the general mood is so friendly and easy it seems impossible to disturb

"
No surprise, Navidson fails to fall asleep
He tosses around for an hour until he finally gets up and goes off in search of his camera

Navidson carefully nudges his flashlight into this new darkness and discovers an even longer corridor
"This one's easily
It is at least fifteen feet wide with a ceiling well over ten feet high
The length of this one, however, is impossible to estimate as Navidson's flashlight proves useless against the darknes s ahead, dying long before it can ever come close to determining an end
Navidson pushes ahead, moving deeper and deeper into the house, eventually passing a number of doorway s leading off into alternate passageways or chambers

"Here's a door
Flashlight and camera skitter across ceiling and floor in loose harmony , stabbing into small rooms, alcoves, or spaces reminiscent of closets , though no shirts hang there
Still, no matter how far Navidson proceeds down this particular passageway , his light never comes close to touching the punctuation point promised by the converging perspective lines, sliding on and on and on, spawning one space after another , a constant stream of comers and walls, all of them unreadable and perfectly smooth
Finally, Navidson stops in front of an entrance much larger than the rest

Finally, Navidson stops in front of an entrance much larger than the rest
It arcs high above his head and yawns into an undisturbed blackness
His flashlight finds the floor but no walls and, for the first time, no ceiling
Only now do we begin to see how big Navidson's house really is
Something should be said here about Navidson's hand

Out of all the footage he personally shoots, there rarely exists a shake, tremble, jerk, or even a case of poor framing
His camera, no matter the circumstances, manage s to view the world-even this world-with a remarkable steadiness as well as a highly refined aesthetic sensibility
Comparisons immediately make Navidson's strengths apparent
Holloway Robert s' tape is virtually unwatchable: tilted frames, out of focus, shakes, horrible lighting and finally oblivion when faced with danger
Likewise Karen and Tom' s tapes reflect their inexperience and can only be considered for content
Only the image s Navidson shoots capture the otherness inherent in that place
Undeniably Navidson's experience as a photojournali st gives him an advantage over the rest when focusing on something that is as terrifying as it is threatening

But, of course, there is more at work here than just the courage to stand and focus

As Navidson takes his first step through that immense arch, he is suddenly a long way away from the wann light of the living room
In fact his creep into that place resembles the eerie faith required for any deep sea exploration, the beam of his flashlight scratching at nothing but the invariant blackness
In fact his creep into that place resembles the eerie faith required for any deep sea exploration, the beam of his flashlight scratching at nothing but the invariant blackness
Navidson keeps his attention focused on the floor ahead of him, and no doubt because he keeps looking down, the floor begins to assume a new meaning
It can no longer be taken for granted
tarily shattered it
Navidson freezes, unsure whether or not he really just heard something growl
"I better be able to find my way back," he finally whispers, which though probably muttered in jest suddenly catches him off guard
"I better be able to find my way back," he finally whispers, which though probably muttered in jest suddenly catches him off guard
Navidson swiftly turns around
Much to his horror, he can no longer see the arch let alone the wall
This is the direction he decides on, and within less than a minute the beam from his flashlight finds something more than darkness
Quickenin g his pace slightly, Navidson reaches the wall and the safety he perceives there
He now faces another decision: left or right
Again that faint growl returns, rolling through the darkness like thunder
Navidson quickly does an about face and returns to the dooiway
Only now he discovers that the penny be left behind, which should have been at least a hundred feet further, lies directly before him
The corridor is now much narrower and ends very quickly in a T
He has no idea which way to go, and when a third growl ripples through that place, this time significantly louder, Navidson panics and starts to run
His sprint, however, lasts only a few seconds
"Tom
" he tries, briefly catching hold of the -om's as they too start to vanish, though before doing so completely, Navidson momentarily detects in the last -om a slightly higher pitch entwined in his own voice
He waits a moment, and not hearing anything else, shouts again: "I' m in here
" giving rise to tripping on-ear's reverberating and fading, until in the next to last instant a sharp cry comes back to him, a child 's cry, calling out for him, drawing him to the right
By shouting "I'm here" and following the add-ee's singing off the walls, Navidson slowly begins to make his way through an incredibly complex and frequently disorienting series of turns
Eventually after backtracking several times and making numerous wrong choices, occasionally descending into disturbing territories of silence, the voice begins to grow noticeably louder, until finally Navidson slips around a corner, certain he has found his way out

Eventually after backtracking several times and making numerous wrong choices, occasionally descending into disturbing territories of silence, the voice begins to grow noticeably louder, until finally Navidson slips around a corner, certain he has found his way out
Instead though, he encounters only more darkness and this time greater quiet
And then quite abruptly he steps to the right through a low passageway and discovers a corridor terminating in warm yellow light, lamp light, with a tiny silhouette standing in the dooiway, tugging her daddy home with a cry
Emerging into the safety of his own living room, Navidson immedi
ately scoops Daisy up in his arms and gives her a big hug
"I had a nightmare," she says with a very serious nod
Similar to the Khumbu Icefall at the base of Mount Everest where blue seracs and chasms change unexpectedly throughout the day and night, Navidson is the first one to discover how that place also seems to constantly change
Unlike the lcefall, however, not even a single hairline fracture appears in those walls
71
After putting his daughter back to bed, Navidson finds Karen standing in the entrance to their room
open it
"
Navidson starts to go back downstairs
"I'm sorry Navy," Karen says quietly
" Their bodies had repaired what words never tried to, and at least for a little while they felt close again
The next morning, with harmony now restored, Navidson cannot bring himself to tell Karen about his visit
Fortunately having nearly gotten lost inside his own house has for the moment diminished his appetite for its darkness
"
Navidson admits in his: "I feel lousy about lying to Karen
But I think it's unreasonable of her to expect me not to investigate
"
Navidson lifts his daughter onto his lap
"Okay
-Christian Norberg-Schulz
When Hillary, the grey coated Siberian husky, appears at the end of The Navidson Record, he is no longer a puppy
A couple of years have passed
One thing however is certain: the house played a very small part in both their histories
The incident took place on August 11th, 1990 a week after Will Navidson's secret exploration of the hallway
Saturday morning cartoons blare from the kitchen television, Chad and Daisy munch down their breakfast, and Karen stands outside smoking a cigarette, talking on the phone with Audrie McCullogh, her shelf building accomplice
real-estate agent
" Meanwhile in the living room, Tom helps Navidson talce some still shots of the hallway using a strobe
Suddenly, somewhere in the house, there is a loud yowl and bark
The only exception is that on this occasion, after dashing up and over the sofa, both puppy and cat head straight down the hallway and disappear into the darkness
Navidson probably would have gone in after them had he not instantly heard barks outside followed by Karen's shouts accusing him of letting the animals out when on that day they were supposed to stay in
"What the hell
"What the hell
" we hear Navidson mutter loudly
Sure enough Hillary and Mallory are in the backyard
For something so startling, it seems surprising how little has been made of this event
Bernard Porch in his four thousand page treatise on The Navidson Record devotes only a third of a sentence to the subject: " , (strange how the house won't support the presence of animals)
"80 Mary Widmunt leaves us with just one terse question: "So what's the deal with the pets
"80 Mary Widmunt leaves us with just one terse question: "So what's the deal with the pets
" 81 Even Navidson himself, the consummate investigator, never revisits the subject
Who knows what might have been discovered if he had
Hillary and Mallory, I suddenly envy them
I wonder if Navidson did too
I bet Zampano envied them
Dissatisfaction motivates him, and at forty-eight, he still drives himself harder than any man half his age
Consequently, when he steps onto Navidson's front lawn, arms folded, eyes scrutinizing the house, bees flying near his boots, he looks less like a guest and more like some conquistador landing on new shores, preparing for war
Born in Menomonie, Wisconsin, Holloway Roberts has made a career as a professional hunter and explorer
"8 3
When Navidson told Reston how Karen had explicitly asked him not to explore the hallway-and presumably Navidson described the discoveries he made during Exploration A-the first person Reston called was Holloway
Reston had met Holloway four years earlier at a symposi um on arctic gear design held at Northwestern University
'fS;Within a week he had arrived at the house, along with two employees: Jed Leeder and Kirby "Wax" Hook
As we learn in The Navidson Record, Jed Leeder lives in Seattle, though he was originally from Vineland, New Jersey
He had actually been on hi s way to becoming a career truck driver when a trans-continental job took him all the way to Washington
" 87
"This though has to be the weirdest ," Wax later tells Navidson , right before making his last foray down the hallway
"When Holloway asked me
Karen says a brief hello and leaves to pick the children up from school
Reston makes the necessary introductions and then after everyone has gathered in the living room, Navidson begins to explain what he knows about the hallway
He shows them a map he drew based on his first visit Tellingly, this hardly strikes Tom as news
He shows them a map he drew based on his first visit Tellingly, this hardly strikes Tom as news
While Navidson does his best to impress upon everyone the dangers posed by the tremendous size of that place as well as the need to record in detail every part of the exploration, Tom passes out xerox copies of his brother's diagram
Jed finds it difficult to stop smiling while Wax finds it difficult to stop laughing
Holloway keeps throwing glances at Reston
In spite of the tape he saw, Holloway seems convinced that Navidson has more than a few loose wing nuts jangling around in bis cerebral cortex
But when the four dead bolts are at last unlocked and the hallway door drawn open, the icy darkness instantly slaughters every smile and glance
" he finally asks
"You're about to find out," Navidson replies, sizing up the man, a half-smile on his lips
"Just be carefu l of the shifts
"
From the first time they shake hands on the doorstep, it is obvious to us Navidson and Holloway dislike each other
Neither one says anything critical but both men bristle in each other 's presence
Neither one says anything critical but both men bristle in each other 's presence
Holloway is probably a little unnerved by Navidson's distinguished career

Karen would refrain from relying on other men to mollify her insecurities if Navidson curbed his own risk-lust and gave domesticity a real shot
After all, as Karen later intimated, their home was supposed to bring them closer together
89 The appearance of the hallway, however, tests those informal vows
Navidson finds himself constantly itching to leave his family for that place just as Karen discovers old patterns surfacing in herself
Later that evening, Holloway places his hand on Karen's back and makes her laugh with a line the camera never hears

Navidson immediately
88See Newt Kuellster's "The Five and a Half Minute Holloway" in The Holloway Question (San Francisco: Metalambino Inc
bumps Holloway aside with his shoulder, revealing, for one thing, his own easily underestimated strength
Navidson, however, reserves his glare for Karen
She laughs it off but the uneasy energy released recalls Leslie Buckman and Dale Corrdigan's accusations
90
Yet even after Navidson's interjection, Holloway still finds it difficult to keep his eyes off of Karen
Her flirting hardly helps
Her flirting hardly helps
She is bright, extremely sexual, and just as Navidson has always enjoyed danger, she has always thrived on attention
Karen brings the men beers and they go outside with her and light her cigarettes
It matters very little what they say, her eyes always flash, she gives them that famous smile, and sure enough soon they are all doting on her
Navidson confides to his Hi 8," I can't tell you how much I' d like to deviate that fucker' s [Holloway's] septum
" And then later on mutters somewhat enigmatically: "For that I should throw her out
" And then later on mutters somewhat enigmatically: "For that I should throw her out
" Still aside from these comments and the strong nudge he gave Holloway, Navidson refrains from open ly displaying any other signs of jealousy or rage
Unfortunately he also refrains from openly considering the signifi
Furthermore , all his toe nails are horribly cracked, disfigured, and yellow
"Perpetuated," Navidson informs us
"By a nasty fungus two decades worth of doctors finally ended up calling S-T-R-E -S-S
" Sitting by himself on the edge of the tub, blood stained socks draped over the edge, he carefully spreads a silky ointment around what he glibly calls his "light fantastic toe
" It is one of the more naked moments of Navidson, and especially considering its placement in the sequence, seems to reveal in a non-verbal way some of the anxiety Karen's flirtation with Holloway has provoked in him
All of which becomes pretty irrelevant as Holloway soon spends most of his hours leading his team down that lightless hallway
Frequently treatment of the first three explorations has concentrated on the physical aspects of the house
Florencia Calzatti, however, has shown in her compelling book The Fraying of the American Family (New York: Arcade Publishing, 1995)-no longer in print -how these invasions begin to strip the Navidsons of any existing cohesion
It is an interesting examination of the complex variables implicit in any intrusion
90Refer to footnotes 19 and 20 concerning Karen' s infidelities
Perhaps it also should be noted here that for all his wanderings Navidson was pointedly not promiscuous
Good looks, intelligence, and fame did not combine to create an adulterous lifestyle

" However, Australian native, Ryan Murray in his book Wilder Ways (Sydney: Outback Works, 1996) calls Navidson's monastic habits "a sure sign of unresolved oedipal anxieties, repressed homosexuality, and a disturbed sense of self
Considering the time he spent away from home coupled with the kind of offers he got from the most exotic and tantalizing women (not even including those from his numerous female assistants), his refusal proves a nauseating absence of character
Make no mistake about it: over here his kind enter a bar with a smile and leave with a barstool for a hat
" An odd thing to say considering Navidson drank freely in every Australian bar he ever visited and on the one occasion when he was attacked by two drunks, purportedly angry over all the attention the waitresses were lavishing on him, both inebriates left bruised and bleeding

Without focusing too closely on the fine filigree of detail presented in these pieces-a book in itself-it is worthwhile, however briefly, to track the narrative events of the three explorations and recite to some degree how they effect the Navidsons

Navidson ties one end of some fishing line to the hallway door and then hands the spool to Holloway
"There's almost two miles of line here," he tells him
"
Karen says nothing when she hears Navidson make this comment, though she does get up abruptly to go out to the backyard and smoke a cigarette
It is particularly eerie to watch Holloway and his team disappear down the long hallway, while just outside Karen paces back and forth in the light of a September day, oblivious of the space she repeatedly crosses though for whatever reason cannot penetrate
An hour later, Holloway, Jed, and Wax return
When their Hi 8 tapes are replayed in the living room, we watch along with everyone else how a series of lefts eventually leads them to the apparently endless corridor which, again to the left, offers entrance into that huge space where Navidson almost got lost
Though Holloway's ability to shoot this trip hardly compares to the expertise evident in Navidson ' s Exploration A, it is still thrilling to follow the trio as they investigate the darkness

Their flashlights, much more powerlul than Navidson 's, illuminate a ceiling at least two hundred feet high
A little later, at least fifteen hundred feet away, they discover an opposing wall
One -Holloway runs out of fishing line
In fact, he briefly considers setting the spool down, when two-he hears the growl Navidson had warned them about
A little rattled by the sound, Holloway decides to tum back in order to better consider their next move
A little rattled by the sound, Holloway decides to tum back in order to better consider their next move
As Navidson foretold, they soon see for themselves how all the walls have shifted (though not as severely as they had for Navidson )
Fortunately, the changes have not severed the fishing line and the three men find their way back to the living room with relative ease
neon markers
He virtually ignores Navidson, putting Wax in charge of a 35mm camera and instructing Jed on how to collect scratchings from all the walls they pass along the way
Reston provides the dozen or so sample jars
It is almost as if continued use deters the growl and preserves the path they walk
Aside from feeling generally incensed by what he perceives as Holloway's postured authority, Navidson almost goes berserk listening to the discoveries on the radio
Reston and Tom try to cheer him up and to Navidson's credit he tries to act cheerful, but when Jed announces they have crossed what he names the Anteroom and entered what Holloway starts calling the Great Hall, Navidson finds it increasingly more difficult to conjure even a smile

Radio psychologist Fannie Lamkins believes this is a clear cut example of the classic male struggle for dominance:
case in the center which is over two hundred feet in diameter and spirals down into noth
ing, Navidson has to hand Reston the radio, unable to muster another word of support
He has been deprived of the right to name what he inherently understands as his own
93
Lamkins sees Navidson's willingness to obey Karen 's injunction as a sacrifice on par with scarification, "though invisible to Karen
"94
"95
When Holloway plays back the Hi 8s for everyone, Navidson's frustrations get the best of him
He leaves the room
It hardly helps that Karen stays, entirely engrossed in Holloway' s presentation and the ghostly if inadequate images of a banister frozen on the monitor
Tom, actually, pulls her aside and tries to convince her to let Navidson lead the next exploration
"Tom," she replies defensively

Navidson had to look for almost an hour before he finally found him

Instead of scolding him, Navidson helped out
By ten, they had returned home with jars full of light and hands sticky with ice cream
Exploration #3 ends up lasting almost twenty hours
Relying primarily on the team's radio transmissions interspersed with a few clips from the Hi 8s, Navidson relates how Holloway, Jed, and Wax take forty
five minutes to reach the Spiral Staircase only to spend the next seven hours walking down it
86
Even after seeing Navidson's accomplished shots, it is hard to disagree with Holloway
The darkness recreated in a lab or television set does not begin to tell the true story
Rosie O'Donnell, however, offered a different perspective when she wryly remarked on Entertainment Tonight: "The fact that Holloway waited that long to use a compass only goes to show how men-even explorers-sti ll refuse to ask for directions
" 102see Luther Shepard's chapter entitled "The Compass School" in The Complete Feng Shui Guide for 'Ih& NavidsonRecord(New York: Barnes & Noble, 1996), p

With the excep tion of a few weeks in July, he has not worked in over three months
As Tom explains to Karen and Navidson, "the time's come for me to put ass in gear and get on with my life
" He also tells them the time has come for them to contact the media and find a new house
" He also tells them the time has come for them to contact the media and find a new house
Originally Tom had intended to leave right after Exploration #3 but when Navidson begs him to stay through Exploration #4, he agrees
Reston also sticks around
He and Tom both live at the house , Tom in the study ,103 Reston crashing on the pull-out in the living room, while Holloway, Jed, and Wax-at least up until Exploration #4 -stay at a local motel
From all the clips leading up to Exploration #4, we can see how both Navidson and Holloway expect to gain a great deal of fame and fortune
Even if Holloway 's team does not reach the bottom of the staircase, both men agree their story will guarantee them national attention as well as research grants and speaking opportunities
Holloway 's company will more than likely thrive, to say nothing of the reputations of all those involved
This kind of talk, on the day before Exploration #4 is scheduled to start, actually manages to bring Navidson and Holloway a little closer together
There is still a good deal of unspecified tension between them but Holloway warms to discussions of success, especially to the idea of, to use Navidso n's words, "go ing down in history

Nevertheless, what these short clips do not show is the paranoia growing within him
Nevertheless, what these short clips do not show is the paranoia growing within him
As we are well aware, future events will ultimately reveal how much Holloway feared Navidson would get rid of him and thus deprive him of the recognition he had a spent a lifetime trying to obtain, the recognition the house seemed to promise
Of course, Karen will have nothing to do with such talk
She clearly despises anything that might suggest a longer, more protracted relationship with the oddities of their home
Daisy, on the other hand, keeps close to Navidson, picking at tiny scabs on her wrists, always sitting on her father's should ers or when that proves impossib le on Tom's
Chad turns out to be the most problem atic
91
Navidson breaks off his conversation with Holloway to find out what happened
Chad, however, refuses to speak
We're trying to reach the bottom of the stairs
Who knows, if we do that then maybe we'll even discover something before Navidson starts all the hoopla involved with raising
105Leon Robbins' Operation #4: The Art of Internal Medicine (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania, 1996), p
Unlike Explorations # 1 thru #3, for Exploration #4 Holloway decides to take along his rifle
When Navidson asks him "what the hell" he plans to shoot, Holloway replies: "Just in case
"
"
By this point, Navidson has settled on the belief that the persistent growl is probably just a sound generated when the house alters its internal layout
Holloway, however, is not at all in accordance with this assessment
Holloway, however, is not at all in accordance with this assessment
Furthermore, as he pointedly reminds Navidson, he is the team captain and the one responsible for everyone's safety: "With all due respect, since I'm also the one actually going in there, your notions don' t really hold much water with me
" Wax and Jed do not object
"I mean what if you' re wrong
" he asks Navidson
"What if that
You wanna leave us defenseless
" Navidson drops the subject
The question of weapons aside, another big point of concern that comes up is communication
That evening, Holloway, Jed, and Wax move from their motel and camp out in the living room with Reston
Navidson briefs Holloway for the last time on the most efficacious way to handle the cameras
Jed makes a brief call to his fiancee in Seattle and then helps Reston organize the sample jars

If Holloway's hand on Karen had upset Navidson, it is hard to imagine what his reaction would have been had he walked in on this particular moment
However when he finally did see the tape so much had happened, Navidson, by his own admission, felt nothing

" 109
The clip of Karen and Wax did not appear in the first release print of The Navidson Record but apparently was edited in a few months later
Miramax never commented on the inclusion nor did anyone else
Perhaps she forgot it was there or planned to destroy it later
Then again perhaps she wanted Navidson to see it
Regardless of her intentions, the shot catches Karen and Wax alone in the kitchen
For some reason both of them speak very softly
On the counter, someone has left a copy of the map Navidson drew following Exploration A Karen occasionally glances over at it
"Did you do that
"
Based on the film, it is impossible for us to tell if Holloway, Jed, or Wax were ever explicitly told not to mention to Karen Navidson's illegal excursion
Wax, however, does not seem to recognize any trespass in his admission
He cleans up the mess instead
A few months later Navidson saw the kiss
By that time Karen was gone along with everyone else
-The Oxford English Dictionary
Billy Reston glides into frame, paying no attention to the equipment which Navidson over the last few weeks has been setting up in the living room, including though not limited to, three monitors, two 3/4" decks, a VHS machine, a Quadra Mac, two Zip drives, an Epson colour printer, an old PC, at least six radio transmitters and receivers, heavy spools of electrical cord, video cable, one 16mm Aniflex , one 16mm Bolex, a Minolta Super 8, as well as additional flashlights, flares, rope, fishing line (anything from braided Dacron to 40 lb multi-strand steel), boxes of extra batteries, assorted tools, compasses twitching to the odd polarities in the house, and a broken megaphone , not to mention surrounding shelves
already loaded with sample jars, graphs, books, and even an old microscope
"
The obvious choice would have been to structure the segment around Holloway's journey but clearly nothing about Navidson is obvious
He keeps his camera trained on Billy who serves now as the expedition's base commander

In grainy 7298 (probably pushed one T-stop), Navidson captures this crippled man expertly maneuvering his wheelchair from radio to tape recorder to computer, his attention never wavering from the team's progress

By concentrating on Reston at the beginning of Exploration #4, Navidson provides a perfect counterpoint to the murky world Holloway navigates
Confining us to the comforts of a well-lit home gives our varied imaginations a chance to fill the adjacent darkness with questions and demons

It also further increases our identification with Navidson, who like us, wants nothing more than to penetrate first hand the mystery of that place
Other directors might have intercut shots of the ' Base Camp' or 'Command Post ' 110 with Holloway's tapes but Navidson refuses to view Exploration #4 in any other way except from Reston 's vantage point

Naguib Paredes, however, goes one step further than Clary, passing over questions concerning the structure of anticipation in favor of a slightly different, but perhaps more acute analysis of Navidson's strategy: "First and foremost, this restricted perspective subtly and somewhat cunningly allows Navidson to materialize his own feelings in Reston, a man with fearsome intelligence and energy but who is nonetheless-and tragically I might add-physically handicapped
Not by chance does Navidson shoot Reston's wheelchair in the photographic idiom of a prison: spokes for bars, seat like a cell, glimmering brake resembling some kind of lock

As predicted, by the first night Holloway and the team start to lose radio contact
Navidson reacts by focusing on a family of copper-verdigris coffee cups taking up residence on the floor like settlers on the range while nearby a pile of sunflower seed shells rises out of a bowl like a volcano born on some unseen plate in the Pacific
In the background, the ever
able wind
Considering the grand way these moments are photographed, it almost appears as if Navidson is trying through even the most quotidian objects and events to evoke for us some sense of Holloway' s epic progress
That or participate in it

113Navidson's camera work is an infinitely complex topic
Edwin Minamide in Objects of a Thousand
Facets (Bismark, North Dakota: Shive Stuart Press, 1994), p
421, asserts that such "resonant images," especially those in this instance, conjure up what Holloway could never have achieved: "The fact that Navidson can photograph even the dirtiest blue mugs in a way that reminds us of pilgrims on a quest proves he is the necessary narrator without whom there would be no film; no understanding of the house

There are long conversations, there are long silences
Sometimes Navidson and Tom play Go
Sometimes one reads aloud to Daisy114 while the other assists Chad with some role-playing game on the family computer
Karen keeps clear of the living room, entering only once to retrieve the coffee cups and empty the bowl of sunflower seed shells
When Navidson's camera finds her, she is usually on the phone in the kitchen, the TV volume on high, whispering to her mother, closing the door
But even as the days lose themselves in night and find themselves again come dawn only to drag on to yet more hours of lightless passage, Billy Reston remains vigilant
But even as the days lose themselves in night and find themselves again come dawn only to drag on to yet more hours of lightless passage, Billy Reston remains vigilant
As Navidson shows us, he never loses focus, rarely leaves his post, and constantly monitors the radios, never forgetting the peril Holloway and the team are in
Janice Whitman was right when she noted another extraordinary quality: "Aside from the natural force of his character, his exemplary intellect, and the constant show of concern for those participating in Exploration #4, what I'm still most struck by is [Reston 's] matter of fact treatment of this twisting labyrinth extending into nowhere
of shells, the maze like way equipmen t and furniture are arranged, all reveal how the everyday can contain objects emblematic of what's lyrical and what's epic in our lives
Navidson shows us how a sudden sense of the world, of who or where we are or even what we do not have can be found in even the most ordinary things
"
100
All the images Navidson finds during this period are beautifully
concise
Even the
occasional shot of Navidson himself, pacing around the living room,
communicates the impatience he feels over being denied this extraordinary
A single shot never includes more than one person
Everything seems to be on the verge of breaking apart, whether between Navidson and Karen, the family as a whole, or even the expedition itself
On the seventh day there is still no sign of the team
Ironically enough, it is the call for assistance that eliminates the jump cuts and reintegrates everyone again into a single frame
Navidson has finally been granted the opportunity he has been waiting for all along
Consequently, with Navidson suddenly in charge now, declaring his intent to lead a rescue attempt, the sequence immediately starts to resolve with the elimination of visual tensions

Consequently, with Navidson suddenly in charge now, declaring his intent to lead a rescue attempt, the sequence immediately starts to resolve with the elimination of visual tensions
Karen, however, is furious
" she demands
"Why does it have to be the great Will Navidson who goes to the rescue
" Her question is a good one, but unfortunately it only has one answer: because he is the great Will Navidson
"Why does it have to be the great Will Navidson who goes to the rescue
" Her question is a good one, but unfortunately it only has one answer: because he is the great Will Navidson
Considering the circumstances, it does seem a little ludicrous for Karen to expect a man who has thrived his whole life under shell fire and
napalm to turn his back on Holloway and go drink lemonade on the porch
Furthermore, as Navidson points out, "They've been in there almost eight days with water for six
It's three in the morning
" and its adamantine mystery stops Karen cold
Without saying another word, she sits down on the couch and waits for Navidson to finish organizing all the equipment they will need
It talces only thirty minutes to assemble the necessary supplies
If not , the plan is for Reston to go as far as the stairway where he will establish a camp and
handle the radios, serving as a relay between the living room command post and Navidson and Tom who will continue on down the stairs
As far as photographic equ ipment is concerned, everyone wears a Hi 8 in a chest harnes s

Thus while representing the emergency signal sent by Holloway's team, Navidson also uses the dissonance implicit in his home-bound wait-the impatience, frustration, and increasing familial alienation-to figuratively and now literally send out his own cry for help
The irony comes when we realize that Navidson fashioned this piece long after the Holloway disaster occurred but before he made his last plunge into that place

In other words his SOS is entirely without hope
It either comes too late or too early
Navidson, however, knew what he was doing
It is not by accident that the last two short shots of SOS show Karen on the phone, thus providing an acoustic message hidden within the already established visual one: three busy signals, three rings

It is too complex to adequately address here; for some, however, this mention alone may prove useful when considering the meaning of 'play', 'origins', and 'ends'-especially when applied to the Navidson house:
Ce centre avail pour fonction non seulement d'orienter et d'equilibrer, d'organiser la structure-on ne peut en elfet penser une structure inorganisee-mais de faire surtout que le principe d'organisation de la structure limite ce que nous pourrions appeler le jeu 131 de la structure
ken or learned
Albert Einstein's work on this matter is also worth studying, though it is important not to forget how Navidson's house ultimately confounds even the labyrinth of the inner ear
133
This not only applies to the house but to the film itself
From the outset of The Navidson Record, we are involved in a labyrinth , meandering from one celluloid cell to the next, trying to peek around the next edit in hopes of finding a solution, a centre, a sense of whole, only to discover another sequence, leading in a completely different direction, a continually devolving discourse, promising the possibility of discovery while all along dissolving into chaotic ambiguities too blurry to ever completely compre
