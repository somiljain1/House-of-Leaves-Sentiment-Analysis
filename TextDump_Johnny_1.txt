And then the nightmares will begin

The story's an absolute crock of shit, or should I say a wok of shit-sorry; I know, I know I should learn to crawl before I walk; sorry again; I mean for not being sorry the first time or for that matter the second time-but, you see, it's so hard to argue with all those whirls of melted flesh
"Show them your arms, Johnny" Lude will say, in his most offhand over -the-top manner
"Aw come on
" The total suddenly climbing to an impossible six words
"Johnny," I mumbled, promptly earning four more words
And just like that
My boss may think I can't draw worth shit but he knows I build needles better than anyone
He calls me all the time on my tardiness, my tendency to drift & moither and of course the odds that I'll ever get to tattoo anything-"Johnny, nothing you do, (shaking his head) no one's ever gonna wanna make permanent, unless they're crazy, and let me tell you something Johnny, crazies never pay"-but about my needle making I've never heard him complain once
Anyway, a couple of hours whiz by
My boss, however, is scared shitless
"Jesus Christ Johnny," he says
"Are you okay
104
"You're alright Johnny," she said in a way that actually made me
feel alright
Almost as i f to say she knew where I'd just been
"You're alright Johnny," she said for the second time that night
"Don't worry so much
Unfortunately I don't think I can do justice to how truly strange this all is, a paradox of sorts, since on one hand I'm laughing at myself, mocking the irrational nature of my anxiety, what I continue in fact to perceive as a complete absurdity-¥
mean Johnny what do you really have to be afraid of
¥ -while on the other hand, and at the same time mind you, finding myself absolutely terrified, if not of something in particular -t here were no particulars as far as I could see--then of the reaction itself, as undeniable & unimpeachable as Zampano's black trunk
The knocking in the house returning this vivid recollection
¥Johnny¥ she said in a sigh even more gentle
than a whisper

several respons es were received by e-mail including this one:
I think Johnny was a little off here
I wanted to write and tell you about it
The biker could have taught me a thing or two about the impermanence or at least the destructibility of flesh-in this case my flesh -but he was also shocked
Thumper came to my rescue, quickly escorting me outside and ordering me to take the day off: "I don't know what you're getting messed up in Johnny but it's fucking you up bad
" Then she touched my arm and I immediately wanted to tell her everything
Did he leave LA
And what about Johnny
What was all that crazy stuff In the Introduction about guns and blood
He finally asked me what I was doing and I just shrugged and told him I was about to start building needles
"Johnny, are you alright
" he said in a very sincere and concerned tone, without even a note of sarcasm , which was probably the weirdest part
"Sort of, I guess," I replied
"I had to hire someone else, Johnny," he said very quietly, pointing over to a young blonde woman already in the process of cleaning out the back storeroom
"You've been gon e for three weeks
Apparently even my boss has been asking about me, acting all hurt that I haven't dropped by to hang out or at least say hello
"Hey Johnny," Thumper finally purred over the phone
"Why don't you come over to my place
referred to as The Whale
"You know where your mother is, Johnny," he'd
tell me

They had discussed the footnotes, the names and even the encoded appearance of Thamyris on page 387 , something I'd transcribed without ever detecting
Apparently they wondered alot about Johnny Truant
Had he made it to Virginia

Dearest Johnny,
You would have received a hundred more letters before now if the Director had not "strongly recommended" I curtail my epistolary efforts
He told me you had runaway twice
Good lord Johnny, where does an eleven year old go for three
days

Never neglect your mind Johnny
You were born with substantial faculties

My gentle Johnny , -bambino dell'oro-
Born on the day most suffused with sun, you have always been and always will be my light

My cherished Johnny,
I dreamt about you last night
October 15, 1983
Dear, dear Johnny,
What beautiful words you have in you and so evenly placed and wisely arranged
March 15, 1984
My dear cherished Johnny,
Forgive your mother
April 22, 1984
My dear, delightful Johnny,
I'm infinitely pleased by news of your continued recovery but thoroughly confused by the latter content of your letter
June 3, 1984
My cherished Johnny ,
I have decided not to question your silence
June 26, 1984
My dear Johnny , Your sentences cast spells
Once again you've
When you return from camp you will find your birthday present
September 7, 1984 Dear, dearest Johnny,
To endure over two months without a word and then with the first words learn such terrible news tore me to pisces
The reasons why you fled to the fields and lived for eight days-an anonym, a no one, a survivor-are no secret to me
Clearly you have great skills to last the world in such zones of deprivation but realize something Johnny, your abilities can take you much farthe r than that
You only have to believe it, then you will find a better escape
October 14, 1984
My dear Johnny,
What an exceptional idea
March 7, 1985
Dear, sweet Johnny, I am still alive
Unfortunately the dead of
At least thoughts of you brought me moments of peace
Just the mention of Johnny conjured up sweet memories of rain soaked meadows, mint sprigs in tea and sailboats slewing wakes of phosphorescence at midnight-an entire history of the stars briefly caught in the Sound
My lovely son, please pardon your mother's silence
May 11, 1985
Dear dear devoted Johnny,
Is it possible
July 24, 1985
Dear Johnny,
Where are you
Though I doubt he'd ever admit it, the New Director sneers whenever he addresses me
Ah Johnny I could write you like this for days
Your appearance made me so happy
September 5, 1985
Dearest Johnny,
I am doing my best to accept your decision to leave me in such silence
September 14, 1985
Oh my dear Johnny,
Doesn't your mother feel sillier than ever
September 19, 1985
Dear, dear Johnny,
This is somewhat urgent
October 4, 1985
Dearest Johnny,
Terrible news
October 10, 1985
Dear, dear, dear Johnny,
Where have you gone
October 12, 1985
Dear and cherished Johnny,
See how incensed your mother is
November 1, 1985
Dearest Johnny,
Will you ever accept this apology
April 5, 1986
Dear, dear Johnny, center and whole of my world,
I cannot understand how you have not received any of my letters
May 31, 1986
Dear dear flesh of mine, spirit of mine, My Johnny,
Alaska again
July 6, 1986
Dear only son, only mine, my Johnny,
Your mother 's mind's a mess
-surgically altered her and then after many months of rehearsal introduced her to you as the very same soul of your breath, source of your being
Dear Johnny, you must disregard all you assumed you gleaned in that encounter
Toss everything and don't worry: I forgive you for failing to recognize this woman as a fraud
September 18, 1986
Dear, dear Johnny, my sun in winter , my reason in fog,
At last we're out in the open
April 25, 1987
Dearest gifted Johnny,
I did not think your silence would ever end and yet somehow it did and now I am in blissful possession of a new address and news of your placement in another boarding school
April 27, 1987
Dear, dear Johnny ,
Pay attention: the next letter I will encode as follows: use the first letter of each word to build subsequent words and phrases: your exquisite intuition will help you sort out the spaces: I've sent this via a night nurse: our secret will be safe
May 8, 1987
Dearest everything and remarkably elegant seraphim's truth Johnny oh heaven's near nearing you,
Tell hope everything you hear and value every fine outward understanding near day at windows and yore told over by rectopathic elephants announcing karmic meddling ends
Said undertaking cold hands announce sorry instincts lighting lips you gave in red lines
Yesterday opaque uncertainty measured uncertainty so tediously so advanced versions estimated meant early Johnny oh heroic new nimble you
Is no telling heard each native architectura l mention even on former yards on usual rights favored after trillion holes execrate religion

Only love of mine Johnny,

Dear dearest Johnny,
I write you now with the greatest urgency
J anuary 3, 1988
Swee t, swee t Johnny,
Th ough you neve r ask, how many times must I respo nd
March 19, 1988
Dearest dear Johnny,
Do not forget your father stopped me and took me to The
The first thing they did when I got here was tie me down and cut them off
But it was love just the same Johnny
Believe me

The papers all say that "JOHNNY IS TRUANT

What a terrible sleep and dream I've been roused from
November 3, 1988
Dearest Johnny,
As I seem to have been granted temporary clemency from rabid thoughts, reflections pour out of me at an alarming rate
November 27, 1988
Dear, dear Johnny,
So convinced such happiness has to be a dream-especial ly these days-I have repeatedly asked the Director whether or not you were really here yesterday
