After all, as I fast discovered, Zampano's entire project is about a film which doesn't even exist
You can look, I have, but no matter how long you search you will never find The Navidson Record in

I tried contacting all of them
Those that took the time to respond told me they had never heard of Will Navidson let alone Zampano
As for the books cited in the footnotes, a good portion of them are fictitious
Over and over again , in one form or another, he returns to the subject of light, space, shape, line, color, focus, tone, contrast, movement, rhythm, perspective and composition
None of which is surprising considering Zarnpano's piece centers on a documentary film called The Navidson Record made by a Pulitzer
Prize-winning photojournalist who must somehow capture the most difficult subject of all: the sight of darkness itself

For the most part, skeptics call the whole effort a hoax but grudg
ingly admit The Navidson Record is a hoax of exceptional quality
Unfortunately out of those who accept its validity many tend to swear allegiance to tabloid-UFO sightings
ike Melville's behemoth, remains resistant to summation
Much like its subject, The Navidson Record itself is also uneasily contained-whe ther by category or lection
If finally catalogued as a gothic tale, contemporary urban folkmyth, or merely a ghost story, as some have called it, the documentary will still, sooner or later, sl
ip the limits of any one of those genres
Too many important things in The Navidson Record jut out past the borders
Where one might expect horror, the supernatural, or traditional paroxysms of dread and fear, one discovers disturbing sadness, a sequence on radioactive isotopes, or even laughter over a Simpsons episode

Even today many people still feel The Navidson Record, in spite of all its existential refinements and contemporary allusions, continues to reflect those exact sentiments
In fact a few eager intellectuals have already begun to treat the film as a warning in and of itself , perfectly suited for hanging whole above the gates of such schools as Architectonics, Popomo, Consequentialism, Neo-Plasticism, Phenomenology, Information Theory , Marxism, Bioserniotics, to say nothing of psychology , medicine, New Age spirituality, art and even Neo-Minimalism

Will Navidson, however, remains stalwart in his insistence that his documentary should be taken literally
As he himself says, "
Considering how the film ends, it is not surprising that more than a handful of people have decided to heed his advice
The Navidson Record did not first appear as it does today
Nearly seven years ago what surfaced was "The Five and a Half Minute Hallway " -a five and a half minute optical illusion barely exceeding the abilities of any NYU film school graduate
The problem, of course, was the accompanying statement that claimed all of it was true
In one continuous shot, Navidson, whom we never actually see, momentarily focuses on a doorway on the north wall of his living room before climbing outside of the house through a window to the east of that door , where he trips slightly in the flower bed, redirects the camera from the ground to the exterior white clapboard, then moves right, crawling back inside the house through a second window, this time to the west of that door, where we hear him grunt slightly as he knocks his head on the sill, eliciting light laughter from those in the room, presumably Karen, his brother Tom, and his friend Billy Reston-though like Navidson, they too never appear on camera-before finally returning us to the starting point, thus completely circling the doorway and so proving, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that insulation or siding is the only possib le thing this doorway could lead to, which is when all laughter stops, as Navidson's hand appears in frame and pulls open the door, reveal,ing a narrow black hallway at least ten feet long, prompting Navidson to re-investigate, once again leading us on another circumambulation of this strange passageway, climbing in and out of the windows, pointing the camera to where the hallway should extend but finding nothing more than his own backyard-no ten foot protuberance , ju st rose bushes , a muddy dart gun, and the translucent summer air-in essence an exercise in disbelief which despite his best intentions still takes Navidson back inside to that impossible hallway, until as the camera begins
4That first bit comes from Milton's Paradise Lost
"Don't you dare go in there again, Navy," to which Tom adds, "Yeah, not
such a hot idea ," thus arresting Navidson at the threshold, though he still
puts his hand inside, finally retracting and inspecting it, as if by seeing
alone there might be something more to feel, Reston wanting to know if in
fact his friend does sense something different, and Navidson providing the
matter-of-fact answer which also serves as the conclusion, however abrupt,
Less than a year later another short surfaced
It was even more hotly sought after than "The Five and a Half Minute Hallway " and resulted in some fervent quests for Navidson and the house itself, all of which, for one reason or another, failed
Unlike the first, this short was not a continuous shot, prompting many to speculate that the eight minutes making up "Ex ploration #4" were in fact bits of a much larger whole
The structure of "Exploration #4" is highly discontinuous , jarring, and as evidenced by many poor edits, even hurried
The first shot catches Navidson mid-phrase
He is tired, depressed and pale
One shot of a child (Daisy) crying
Then back to Navidson: "No thing but this tape which I've seen enough times, it's more like a memory than anything else
And I still don 't know: was he right or just out of his mind
"
Thus bringing to an end this strange abstract which as the release of The Navidson Record revealed was sparingly incomplete
Then for two years nothing

community did recognize the author as none other than Will Navidson, the prize-winning photojournalist who won the Pulitzer for his picture of a dying girl in Sudan
Unfortunately this discovery only generated a few months of heated speculation, before, in the absence of press, corroboration, the location of the house or for that matter any comment by Navidson himself, interest died out

Unfortunately this discovery only generated a few months of heated speculation, before, in the absence of press, corroboration, the location of the house or for that matter any comment by Navidson himself, interest died out
Most people just wrote it off as some kind of weird hoax, or, because of the unusual conceit, an aberrant UFO sighting
How could anyone be lost in a house for days anyway
Furthermore, what was someone with Navidson's credentials doing creating two strange shorts like these
And again, was this artifice or reality
Certainly a good deal of the debate was sustained by a bit of old fashioned cultural elitism
People talked about the Navidson pieces because they were lucky enough to have seen them
Lee Sinclair suspects a majority of professors , students, SoHo artists and avant-garde filmmakers who spoke-and even wrote-so knowingly about the tapes, more than likely had never even viewed one frame: "There just weren't that many copies available
On a strictly visceral level, they provide ample shocks and curiosities
However, the most unnerving aspect about both pieces is their ability to convince us that everything really happened, some of which can be attributed to the verifiable elements (Holloway Roberts, Will Navidson et al
), but most of which must be chalked up to the starkness of the production-the absence of make-up, expensive sound tracks, or crane shots
Except for framing, editing, and in some cases sub-titles,7 there is virtually no room for creative intrusion
Who would have suspected that almost three years after "The Five and a Half Minute Hallway " began appearing on VHS, Miramax would quietly release The Navidson Record in a limited run and almost immediately unsettle audiences everywhere
Since the opening three years ago last April8 in New York and Los Angeles, The Navidson Record has been screened nationwide, and while hardly a blockbuster, the film continues to generate revenues as well as interest

The Navidson Record now stands as part of this country 's cultural experience and yet in spite of the fact that hundreds of thousands of people have seen it, the film continues to remain an enigma
Some insist it must be true, others believe it is a trick on par with the Orson Welles radio romp The War of the Worlds

These days, with the unlikely prospect of any sort of post-release resolution or revelation, Navidson's film seems destined to achieve at most cult status
Good story telling alone will guarantee a healthy sliver of popularity in the years to come but its inherent strangeness will permanently bar it from any mainstream interest

TheNavidson Record actually contains two films: the one Navidson made, which everyone remembers, and the one he set out to make, which very few people ever detect
While easily overshadowed by the finished film, the filmmaker's original intentions provide an early context in which to view the peculiar properties of the house later on

In many ways, the opening of The Navidson Record, shot back in April of 1990, remains one of the more disturbing sequences because it so effectively denies itself even the slightest premonition about what will soon take place on Ash Tree Lane
Not once during those initial minutes does Navidson indicate he knows anything about the impending nightmare he and his entire family are about to face

Consequently Rosen seriously undervalues the importance ofNavidson's initial intentions

Of course, Navidson's pastoral take on his family's move hardly reflects the far more complicated and significant impetus behind his project-namely his foundering relationship with longtime companion Karen Green

Navidson, we learn, began his project by mounting a number of Hi 8s around the house and equipping them with motion detectors to turn them on and off whenever someone enters or leaves the room

The whole effort would seem very borne movie-ish at best were it not for the fact that Navidson is an exceptionally gifted photographer who understands how one sixtieth of a second can yield an image worth more than twenty-four hours of continuous footage
He is not interested in showing all the coverage or attempting to capture some kind of catholic or otherwise mythical view
Instead he hunts for moments, pearls of the particular, an unexpected phone call, a burst of laughter, or some snippet of conversation which might elicit from us an emotional spark and perhaps even a bit of human understanding
More often than not, the near wordless fragments Navidson selects reveal what explication could only approximate
Two such instances seem especially sublime, and because they are so short and easy to miss, it is worth reiterating their content here

In the first one, we see Navidson climbing to the top of the stairs with a crate full of Karen's things
Their bedroom is still cluttered with lamps in bubble wrap and assorted unpacked suitcases and garbage bags full of clothes
Their bed is not made
Navidson finds some room on top of a bureau to set down his load
He is about to leave when some invisible impulse stops him
Unfortunately, whatever he sees inside is invisible to the camera
When Karen walks in carrying a basket stuffed with bedsheet s and pillow cases, Navidson has already turned his attention to an old hairbrush lying next to some perfume bottles
"What are you doing
" "No," Nav idson replies with a grin
It is unnec essary to dwell here on the multiple ways in which these few seconds demonstrate how much Navidson values Karen, 15 except to highlight how despite his sarcasm and apparent disregard for her things the scene itself represents the exact opposite

Considering how beautiful she appears on the dreadful Hi 8 tapes, it is hardly surpri sing editors frequently relied on slides of her pouty lips, high cheek bones, and hazel eyes to sell their magazines
Early on, Navidson gave Karen a Hi 8 which he asked her to treat like a journal
Her video entries-which Navidson promised to view only after the film was shot and then only if she agreed-reveal a thirty-seven year old woman who worries about leaving the city, growing old, keeping trim, and stayi ng happy

Karen sits with Chad and Daisy in the living room
Though clearly a matter of opinion, Karen's gaze seems just as lost as it is "surfeit with love and longing
"17 The reasons are in part answered when at last Navidson 's car pulls into the driveway
Karen hardly attempts to contain her relief
smugly eyeing Chad even as she continues to snip wicks
Strangely enough, by the time Karen reaches Navidson in the foyer, she has quite effectively masked all her eagerness to see him
Her indifference is highly instructive
Her indifference is highly instructive
In that peculiar contradiction that serves as connective tissue in so many relationships, it is possible to see that she loves Navidson almost as much as she has no room for him
"Hey, the water heater's on the fritz," she manages to say
Unfortunately, critics have been less than sympathetic
Following the release of The Navidson Record, neither Karen nor Navidson's reputation escaped unscathed
Karen, in particular, was decimated by a vituperative stream of accusations from the tabloids, reputable reviewers, and even an estranged sister
A high-fashion model, not much smarter than a radiator, who grew up thinking life revolved around club owners, cocaine and credit card limits
Watching her burble on about her weight, her children, or how much she needs Navidson made me want to retch
How can she say she loves a man when she's incapable of anything even remotely resembling commitment
"20
In retrospect, the rabid speculation over Karen 's infidelities seems driven by a principally sexist culture, especially since so little attention was paid to Navidson' s role in their relationship
As David Liddel once
exclaimed: "If he has horns, who's to say he doesn't have hooves
" 21 Fortunately unlike the biased treatment offered by the media, Navidson does not hesitate to constantly include in his film evidence of his own failings
In fact as of late, many have called into question the accuracy of this self

Not only does Navidson reveal through Karen, Chad, and Daisy how he spent the last decade perfecting a career in distance, where taking off on a moment's notice to shoot Alaskan fishing boats was something his family had to just accept, even if that three day trip slowly evolved into weeks and even months, he also, by way of the film, admits to carrying around his own alienating and intensely private obsessions
As it turns out though, the first hint concerning these dark broodings does not come from him but from Karen
As it turns out though, the first hint concerning these dark broodings does not come from him but from Karen
Navidson 's early Hi 8 journal entries are so easy and mild they rarely, if ever, allude to deeper troubles
Only Karen , staring straight into that little lens, brings up the problem
As it turns out, Karen was not the only one who was kept in the dark about Delial
Even friends and fellow photojournalists who had heard Navidson use the name before never received any sort of explanation
No one had any idea who she was or why it was she haunted his thoughts and conversation like some albatross
23
That said, while the first sequence certainly hints at a number of underlying tension s in the Navidson/Green family, all brought into relief by this chapter, it is crucial not to lose sight of the prevailing sense of bliss still evoked in those opening minutes
After a couple of nights, Chad no longer has trouble sleeping
In fact it is rare to behold such radiant optimism in anything these days, let alone in films, each frame so replete with promise and hope
Navidson clearly cherishes these bucolic, near idyllic impressions of a new world
Of course, nostalgia's role in shaping the final cut must not be forgotten, especially since within a year these pieces were all Navidson had

Terry Borowska, who used to babysit both brothers, remembers how every so often Navidson' s father would vanish, sometimes for up to five weeks at a time, without telling his family where he was going or when he might return
Inevitably when he did come back-typically after midnight, or early in the morning, sitting in his truck, waiting for them to wake up since he had either left his key or lost it-there would be a few days of warmth and reconciliation

Nevertheless, not even ten thousand photographs can secure a world, and so while Navidson may have worked harder, taken greater risks and become increasingly more successful, he was ultimately misled in feeling that his labor could make up for the love he was deprived of as a child and the ultimate sense of security such love bestows
For this reason, we should again revisit Navidson on his porch, his gaze fixed, his delicate fingers wrapped around a glass of lemonade

By definition "outpos t" mean s a base, military or other, which while safe inside functions principally to provide protection from hostile forces found on the outside
This has always seemed a bizarre word to choose to describe a small house in the Virginia countryside, 30 but it does shed some light on why Navidson undertook this project in the first place
More than just snapping a few pictures and recording daily events with a few Hi 8s, Navidson wanted to use images to create an outpost set against the transience of the world

Inearly June of 1990, the Navidsons flew to Seattle for a wedding
When they returned, something in the house had changed
No one could deny there had been an intrusion, but it was so odd no one knew how to respond
On video, we see Navidson acting almost amused while Karen simply draws both hands to her face as if she were about to pray
Their children, Chad and Daisy, just run through it, playing, giggling, completely oblivious to the deeper implications
It is alien, exposed , and unsettling, or in other words, the perfect description of the house on Ash Tree Lane
In their absence, the Navidsons ' home had become something else, and while not exactly sinister or even threatening , the change still destroyed any sense of security or well-being
Upstairs , in the master bedroom, we discover along with Will and Karen a plain, white door with a glass knob
On the opposite end, a second door, identical to the first one opens up into the children's bedroom
Navidson immediately asks whether or not they overlooked the room
This seems ridiculous at first until one considers how the impact of such an implausible piece of reality could force anyone to question their own perceptions
34
Navidson does check the lli 8s but discovers that the motion sensors were never triggered
Only their exit and re-entrance exists on tape
28
Since the discovery occurred in the evening, the Navidsons' inquiry must wait until morning
And so while Chad and Daisy sleep, we watch Karen and Will suffer through a restless night
In fact, the composition and elegant balance of colours, not to mention the lush contrast of light s and darks, are so exquisite they temporarily distract us from any questions concerning the hou se or events unfolding there
It seems a perfect example of Navidson's unparalleled talent and illustrates why few, if any, could have accomplished what he did, especially toward the end
The following day both Karen and Will pursue the most rational course: they acquire the architectural blueprints from their local real estate office
35
Alicia Rosenbaum, the real estate agent responsible for selling the Navidsons the house, gives the camera a bewildered shrug when Karen asks if she has any idea who could be responsible for "this outrage
" Unable to say anything useful , Mrs
As Sheriff Axnard says, "We' ll file a report but other than that, well I don 't know what more we can do

Something, in fact, is very wrong
Navidson repeatedly tacks back and forth from his 25' Stanley Power Lock to the cold blue pages spread out on his bed, until he finally mutters aloud: "This better be a case gf bad math
"
An incongruou s cut prese nts us with the title card: l/4
Outside the house, Navidson climbs up a ladder to the second story
Not an easy ascent he casually confesses to us, explaining how a troublesome skin condition he has had since childhood has recently begun to flare up around his toes
The total comes to 32' 9 3/4" which the house plans corroborate-plus or minus an inch
The puzzling part comes when Navidson measures the internal space
He carefully notes the length of the new area, the length of both bedrooms and then factors in the width of all the walls
The width of the hou se inside would appear to exceed the width of the hou se as measured from the outside by 1/4"
Certain that he has miscalculated, Navidson drills through the outer walls to measure their width precisely
Finally, with Karen's help, he fastens the end of some fishing line to the edge of the outer wall, runs it through the drilled hole, stretches it across the master bedroom, the new space, the children 's bedroom and then runs it through a hole drilled through the opposite wall
32' 10" exactly
Using the same line, Navidson goes outside, stretches the fishing line from one side of the house to the other only to find it is a quarter of an inch too long
Exactly
"Stop drilling holes in my walls
" Undeterred, Navidson continues his quest, even though repeated attempts at measuring the house continue to reveal the quarter-inch anomaly
Karen gets quieter and quieter, Navidson's mood darken s, and responding like finely tuned weathervanes the children react to the change in parental weather by hiding in other parts of the house

The dishwa sher moans, the toaster pops
We watch Karen scan the classifieds as Navidson toys with his coffee
He adds sugar, milk, stirs it all up, stirs it again, and then as an afterthought adds more sugar, a little more milk
brown blot on the morning paper
36 When Navidson looks up Karen is watching him
"I called Tom," he tells her
The next card simply reads: Tom
Tom is Will Navidson's fraternal twin brother
Neither one has said much to the other in over eight years
"
"That means you're family" Karen says happily , leading the way to Navidson's study where she has already set out clean towels and made up the hideaway
36Easily that whole bit from "coffee arcing tragically" down to "the mourning paper" could have been cut
"Usually when you want a level you ask a neighbor or go to the hardware store
Count on Will Navidson to call Lowell, Massachusetts
Where is he

As it turns out Navidson has gone to the hardware store to pick up a few items
In the film, Tom and Navidson's first encounter has almost nothing to do with each other

Instead of addressing any interpersonal issues, we find them both huddled over a Cowley level mirror transit, alternately taking turns peering across the house, the line of sight floating a few feet above the floor, occas ionally interrupted when Hillary or Mallory in some keystone chase race around the children's beds
Later on, out in the backyard, Tom lights up a joint of marijuana
The drug clearly bothers Navidson but he says nothing
Tom knows his brother disapproves but refuses to alter his behavior
Tom is content if there happens to be a game on and a soft place from which to watch it
Navidson works out every day, devours volumes of esoteric criticism, and constantly attaches the world around him to one thing: photography
Tom gets by, Navidson succeeds

Which is how we know they are brothers, because like Tom, Navidson's eyes share the same water
Either way the moment and opportunity for some kind of fraternal healing disappears when Tom makes an important discovery: Navidson was wrong

The interior of the house exceeds the exterior not by 1/4" but by 5/16"
Tom calls Lowell and postpones his construction obligations
Navidson calls an old friend who teaches engineering at UV A
37Look at David Conte's "All Thing Being Equal" in Maclean 's, v
ville
Navidson is not the only one who knows people in the vicinity
Karen 's friend Audrie McCullogh drives down from Washington, D
She keeps close to the homestead and while she may not forage for berries and mushrooms she does accumulate tiny bits of sense
Navidson and Tom, on the other hand, are classic hunters
They select weapons (tools; reason) and they track their prey (a solution)
He is also a paraplegic who has spent almost half his life in an aluminum wheelchair
Navidson was barely twenty-seven when he first met Reston
Actually it was a photograph that brought them together
Actually it was a photograph that brought them together
Navidson had been on assignment in India, taking pictures of trains, rail workers, engineers, whatever caught his attention
The piece was supposed to capture the clamor of industry outside of Hyderabad
I've got a few things you can borrow: a Stanley Beacon level and a laser distance meter
" He grins at Navidson
''The meter's even a Leica

On their way back, Navidson points the Hi 8 toward the darkening
horizon
" A pause
Again Navidson speaks up
"I almost wonder if I got tangled up in all this measuring stuff just
"
"You're telling me," Navidson says, shaking his head
Rain starts splashing down on the windshield and lightning cracks

Navidson grins: "I'm glad to see some things never change
"
And thus as one storm begins to ravage the Virginias, another one just as easily dissipates and vanishes in a flood of bad jokes and old stories
When confronting the spatial disparity in the house, Karen set her mind on familiar things while Navidson went in search of a solution
The children, however, just accepted it
There are certainly no primal associations with spatial anomalies
Similar to the ingenuous opening sequence of The Navidson Re
cord, seeing these two giddy children romp around is an equally unsettling experience, perhaps because their state of nai'vete is so appealing to us, even seductive, offering such a simple resolution to an enigma
As the results are not immediate, we wait along with the whole family as the internal computer calibrates the dimension
Navidson captures these seconds in 16mm
His Arriflex, already pre-focused and left running, spools in 24 frames per second as Daisy and Chad sit on their beds in the background, Hillary and Mallory linger in the foreground near Tom, while Karen and Audrie stand off to the right near the newly created bookshelves

It appears the discrepancy has

"One more time" Navidson says

For all its merits, Hollander 's book only devotes five pages to the actual physics of sound
While this is not the place to dwell on the beautiful and complex properties of reflection, in order to even dimly comprehend the shape of the Navidson house it is still critical to recognize how the laws of physics in tandem with echo's mythic inheritance serve to enhance echo's interpretive strength
The descriptive ability of the audible is easily designated with the following formula:
63Further attention should probably be given to sabins and Transmission Loss as described by TL= 10 Jog 1/ 'r dB, where 'r= a transmission coefficient and a high TL indicates a high sound insulation

43), nothing else has been rendered on this particularly resonant topic
As tape and film reveal, in the month following the expansion of the walls bracketing the book shelves, Billy Reston made several trips to the house where despite all efforts to the contrary, he continued to confirm the confounding impossibility of an interior dimension greater than an exterior one
Navidson skillfully captures Reston's mental frustration by focusing on the physical impediments his friend must face within a house not designed with the disabled in mind
Since the area in question is in the master bedroom , Reston must make his way upstairs each time he wishes to inspect the area
"We ll, and fuck you

Navidson gives his brother a lasting hug

"It even rings," Navidson adds without missing a beat
While there is no question the tone of this exchange is jocular and
The way Tom 's cheeks burn with a sudden flush of color
Or the way Navidson quickly tries to wipe something from his eyes
Certainly the long, lingering shot of Tom as he tosses his duffel bag in the back of Reston 's van, waving the camera good-bye, reveals to us just how much affection Navidson feels for his brother

Strangely enough, following Tom's departure, communication between Navidson and Karen begins to radically deteriorate
An unusual quiet descends on the house
brews more coffee, and keeps track of the real estate market in the classifieds
Frustrated by her unwillingness to discuss the implications of their strange living quarters, Navidson retreats to the downstairs study, reviewing photographs , tapes, even-as a few stills reveal-compiling a list of possible experts, government agencies, newspapers, periodicals, and television shows they might want to approach
At least both he and Karen agree on one thing: they want the chil
Unfortunately, since neither Chad nor Daisy has had a real opportunity to make any new friends in Virginia, they keep to themselves, romping around the backyard, shouting, screaming, stinging each other with darts until eventually they drift farther and farther out into the neighborhood for increasingly longer spates of time
Neither Karen nor Navidson seems to notice
The alienation of their children finally becomes apparent to both of them one evening in the middle of July
Karen is upstairs, sitting on the bed playing with a deck of Tarot cards
Navidson is downstairs in his study examining several slides returned from the lab
News of Oliver North's annulled conviction plays on the TV
In the background, we can hear Chad and Daisy squealing about something, their voices peeling through the house, the strained music of their play threatening at any instant to turn into a brawl
With superb cross-cutting, Navidson depicts how both he and Karen react to the next moment
Karen has drawn another card from the deck but instead of adding it to the cross slowly forming before her crossed legs, the occult image hangs unseen in the air, frozen between her two fingers, Karen's eyes already diverted, concentrating on a sound, a new sound, almost out of reach, but reaching her just the same

Unfortunately the living room Hi 8 cannot follow him nor for that matter can Karen
Fortunately, she does not have to wait too long
Navidson soon reappears with Chad and Daisy in each arm, both of them still clutching a homemade candle, their faces lit like sprites on a winter's eve
This is the first sign of Karen's chronic disability
Up until now there has never been even the slightest indication that she suffers from crippling claustrophobia
By the time Navidson and the two children are safe and sound in the living room, Karen is drenched in sweat
She hug s and holds them as if they had just narrowly avoided some terrible fate, even though neither Chad nor Daisy seems particularly disturbed by their little adventure
they want to go back
Perhaps because of Karen 's evident distress, Navidson agrees to at least temporarily make this new addition to their house off limits
For the rest of the night, Karen keeps a tight grip on Navidson

Since the release of The Navidson Record, Virginia Posah has written extensively about Karen Green's adolescent years
Posah' s thin volume entitled Wishing Well (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 1996) represents one of the few works which while based on the Navidsoos' experience still manage s to stand on its own merits outside of the film
Though Posah goes on to discuss the cultural aspects and consequences of beauty, these details in particular are most disturbing, especially in light of the fact that little of their history appears in the film
Considering the substantial coverage present in The Navidson Record, it is unsettling to discover such a glaring omission
In spite of the enormous quantity of home footage obviously available, for some reason calamities of the past still do not appear

Clearly Karen's personal life, to say nothing of his own life, caused Navidson too much anxiety to portray either one particularly well in his film
Rather than delve into the pathology

of Karen's claustrophobia, Navidson chose instead to focus strictly on the house

She does not seem to care when they discover the hallway has not vanished
She keeps her arms folded, no longer clinging to Navidson's hand or stroking her children

observes that "Karen's attacks, which I suspect stem from early adolescent betrayal, increase proportionally with the level of intimacy-or even the threat of potential intimacy-she experiences whether with Will Navidson or even her children

Karen 's smile is tragic because, in spite of its meaning, it succeeds in remaining so utterly beautiful
The Five and a Half Minute Hallway in The Navidson Record differs slightly from the bootleg copy which appeared in 1990
For one thing, in addition to the continuous circumambulating shot, a wider selection of shots has made the coverage of the sequence much more thorough and fluid
Context also significantly alters "The Five and a Half Minute Hallway
" A greater sense of the Navidsons and their friends and how they all interact with the house adds the greatest amount of depth to this quietly evolving enigma
Their personalities almost crowd that place and suddenly too, as an abrupt jump cut redelivers Tom from Massachusetts and Billy Reston from Charlottesville, the UV A professor once again wheeling around the periphery of the angle, unable to take his eyes off the strange, dark corridor
71 Similarly the hallway also remains meaningless, though it is most assuredly not without effect
As Navidson threatens to reenter it for a closer inspection, Karen reiterates her previous plea and injunction with a sharp and abrupt rise in pitch
The ensuing tension is more than temporary
The ensuing tension is more than temporary
Navidson has always been an adventurer willing to risk his personal safety in the name of achievement Karen, on the other hand, remains the standard bearer of responsibility and is categorically against risks especially those which might endanger her family or her happiness
Tom also shies from danger, preferring to tum over a problem to someone else, ideally a police officer, fireman, or other state paid official

Without sound or movement but by presence alone, the hallway creates a serious rift in the Navidson household
Bazine Naodook suggests that the hallway exudes a "conflict creating force": "It' s those oily walls radiating badness which maneuver Karen and Will into that nonsensical fight
Somehow, and for whatever reason, the thing has grown again
Intermittently, Navidson opens the door himself and stares down the
hallway, sometimes using a flashlight, sometimes just studying the
"What do you do with that
" Navidson asks his brother one eve
ning
"Move," Tom replies
Sadly, even with the unnatural darkness now locked behind a steel door, Karen and Navidson still continue to say very little to each other, their own feelings seemingly as impossible for them to address as the meaning of the hallway itself
61
Chad accompanies his mother to town as she searc hes for various Feng Shui objects guaranteed to change the energy of the home, while Daisy follows her father around the house as he paces from room to room, talking vehemently on the phone with Reston, trying to come up with a feasible and acceptable way to investigate the phenomenon lurking in his living room, until finally, in the middle of all this, he lifts his daughter onto his shoulder s
Unfortunately as soon as Karen returns, Navidson sets Daisy back down on the floor and retreats to the study to continue his discussions alone
With domestic tensions proving a little too much to stomach, Tom escapes to the garage where he works for a while on a doll house he has started to build for Daisy,73 until eventually he takes a break, drifting out to the backyard to get high and hot in the sun, pointedly walking around the patch of lawn the hallway should for all intents and purpose s occupy
He almost seems to enjoy their mischief, growling , yawning, playing along, putting both of them in a headlock, Chad and Daisy laughing hysterically, until finally all three are exhausted and snoozing into dusk
Considering the complexity of Karen and Navidson's relationship, it is fortunate our under stand ing of their problems is not left entirely up to interpretation
Some of their respective views and feelings are revealed in their video journal entries

On the same subject, Navidson offers a similar view: "When we first moved here, Karen was like a college co-ed

"Come on Karen, they're our friends," Navidson says, leading the two celebrities into the living room where he instructs them to look out the window so they can see for themselves his ordinary backyard
Satisfied that they understand nothing but trees and lawn could possibly lie on the other side of the wall, he retrieves the four coloured keys hidden in the antique basinet in the foyer

No surprise, Navidson fails to fall asleep
He tosses around for an hour until he finally gets up and goes off in search of his camera

Navidson carefully nudges his flashlight into this new darkness and discovers an even longer corridor
"This one's easily
It is at least fifteen feet wide with a ceiling well over ten feet high
The length of this one, however, is impossible to estimate as Navidson's flashlight proves useless against the darknes s ahead, dying long before it can ever come close to determining an end
Navidson pushes ahead, moving deeper and deeper into the house, eventually passing a number of doorway s leading off into alternate passageways or chambers

"Here's a door
Flashlight and camera skitter across ceiling and floor in loose harmony , stabbing into small rooms, alcoves, or spaces reminiscent of closets , though no shirts hang there
Still, no matter how far Navidson proceeds down this particular passageway , his light never comes close to touching the punctuation point promised by the converging perspective lines, sliding on and on and on, spawning one space after another , a constant stream of comers and walls, all of them unreadable and perfectly smooth
Finally, Navidson stops in front of an entrance much larger than the rest

Finally, Navidson stops in front of an entrance much larger than the rest
It arcs high above his head and yawns into an undisturbed blackness
His flashlight finds the floor but no walls and, for the first time, no ceiling
Only now do we begin to see how big Navidson's house really is
Something should be said here about Navidson's hand

Out of all the footage he personally shoots, there rarely exists a shake, tremble, jerk, or even a case of poor framing
His camera, no matter the circumstances, manage s to view the world-even this world-with a remarkable steadiness as well as a highly refined aesthetic sensibility
Comparisons immediately make Navidson's strengths apparent
Holloway Robert s' tape is virtually unwatchable: tilted frames, out of focus, shakes, horrible lighting and finally oblivion when faced with danger
Likewise Karen and Tom' s tapes reflect their inexperience and can only be considered for content
Only the image s Navidson shoots capture the otherness inherent in that place
Undeniably Navidson's experience as a photojournali st gives him an advantage over the rest when focusing on something that is as terrifying as it is threatening

As Navidson takes his first step through that immense arch, he is suddenly a long way away from the wann light of the living room
In fact his creep into that place resembles the eerie faith required for any deep sea exploration, the beam of his flashlight scratching at nothing but the invariant blackness
In fact his creep into that place resembles the eerie faith required for any deep sea exploration, the beam of his flashlight scratching at nothing but the invariant blackness
Navidson keeps his attention focused on the floor ahead of him, and no doubt because he keeps looking down, the floor begins to assume a new meaning
It can no longer be taken for granted
tarily shattered it
Navidson freezes, unsure whether or not he really just heard something growl
"I better be able to find my way back," he finally whispers, which though probably muttered in jest suddenly catches him off guard
"I better be able to find my way back," he finally whispers, which though probably muttered in jest suddenly catches him off guard
Navidson swiftly turns around
Much to his horror, he can no longer see the arch let alone the wall
This is the direction he decides on, and within less than a minute the beam from his flashlight finds something more than darkness
Quickenin g his pace slightly, Navidson reaches the wall and the safety he perceives there
He now faces another decision: left or right
Again that faint growl returns, rolling through the darkness like thunder
Navidson quickly does an about face and returns to the dooiway
Only now he discovers that the penny be left behind, which should have been at least a hundred feet further, lies directly before him
The corridor is now much narrower and ends very quickly in a T
He has no idea which way to go, and when a third growl ripples through that place, this time significantly louder, Navidson panics and starts to run
His sprint, however, lasts only a few seconds
"Tom
" he tries, briefly catching hold of the -om's as they too start to vanish, though before doing so completely, Navidson momentarily detects in the last -om a slightly higher pitch entwined in his own voice
He waits a moment, and not hearing anything else, shouts again: "I' m in here
" giving rise to tripping on-ear's reverberating and fading, until in the next to last instant a sharp cry comes back to him, a child 's cry, calling out for him, drawing him to the right
By shouting "I'm here" and following the add-ee's singing off the walls, Navidson slowly begins to make his way through an incredibly complex and frequently disorienting series of turns
Eventually after backtracking several times and making numerous wrong choices, occasionally descending into disturbing territories of silence, the voice begins to grow noticeably louder, until finally Navidson slips around a corner, certain he has found his way out

Eventually after backtracking several times and making numerous wrong choices, occasionally descending into disturbing territories of silence, the voice begins to grow noticeably louder, until finally Navidson slips around a corner, certain he has found his way out
Instead though, he encounters only more darkness and this time greater quiet
And then quite abruptly he steps to the right through a low passageway and discovers a corridor terminating in warm yellow light, lamp light, with a tiny silhouette standing in the dooiway, tugging her daddy home with a cry
Emerging into the safety of his own living room, Navidson immedi
ately scoops Daisy up in his arms and gives her a big hug
"I had a nightmare," she says with a very serious nod
Similar to the Khumbu Icefall at the base of Mount Everest where blue seracs and chasms change unexpectedly throughout the day and night, Navidson is the first one to discover how that place also seems to constantly change
Unlike the lcefall, however, not even a single hairline fracture appears in those walls

After putting his daughter back to bed, Navidson finds Karen standing in the entrance to their room
open it
"
Navidson starts to go back downstairs
"I'm sorry Navy," Karen says quietly
" Their bodies had repaired what words never tried to, and at least for a little while they felt close again
The next morning, with harmony now restored, Navidson cannot bring himself to tell Karen about his visit
Fortunately having nearly gotten lost inside his own house has for the moment diminished his appetite for its darkness

Navidson admits in his: "I feel lousy about lying to Karen
But I think it's unreasonable of her to expect me not to investigate

Navidson lifts his daughter onto his lap

When Hillary, the grey coated Siberian husky, appears at the end of The Navidson Record, he is no longer a puppy
A couple of years have passed
One thing however is certain: the house played a very small part in both their histories
The incident took place on August 11th, 1990 a week after Will Navidson's secret exploration of the hallway
Saturday morning cartoons blare from the kitchen television, Chad and Daisy munch down their breakfast, and Karen stands outside smoking a cigarette, talking on the phone with Audrie McCullogh, her shelf building accomplice
real-estate agent
" Meanwhile in the living room, Tom helps Navidson talce some still shots of the hallway using a strobe
Suddenly, somewhere in the house, there is a loud yowl and bark
The only exception is that on this occasion, after dashing up and over the sofa, both puppy and cat head straight down the hallway and disappear into the darkness
Navidson probably would have gone in after them had he not instantly heard barks outside followed by Karen's shouts accusing him of letting the animals out when on that day they were supposed to stay in
"What the hell
"What the hell
" we hear Navidson mutter loudly
Sure enough Hillary and Mallory are in the backyard
For something so startling, it seems surprising how little has been made of this event
Bernard Porch in his four thousand page treatise on The Navidson Record devotes only a third of a sentence to the subject: " , (strange how the house won't support the presence of animals)
"80 Mary Widmunt leaves us with just one terse question: "So what's the deal with the pets
"80 Mary Widmunt leaves us with just one terse question: "So what's the deal with the pets
" 81 Even Navidson himself, the consummate investigator, never revisits the subject
Who knows what might have been discovered if he had
Hillary and Mallory, I suddenly envy them
I wonder if Navidson did too
I bet Zampano envied them
Dissatisfaction motivates him, and at forty-eight, he still drives himself harder than any man half his age
Consequently, when he steps onto Navidson's front lawn, arms folded, eyes scrutinizing the house, bees flying near his boots, he looks less like a guest and more like some conquistador landing on new shores, preparing for war
Born in Menomonie, Wisconsin, Holloway Roberts has made a career as a professional hunter and explorer
"8 3
When Navidson told Reston how Karen had explicitly asked him not to explore the hallway-and presumably Navidson described the discoveries he made during Exploration A-the first person Reston called was Holloway
Reston had met Holloway four years earlier at a symposi um on arctic gear design held at Northwestern University
'fS;Within a week he had arrived at the house, along with two employees: Jed Leeder and Kirby "Wax" Hook
As we learn in The Navidson Record, Jed Leeder lives in Seattle, though he was originally from Vineland, New Jersey
He had actually been on hi s way to becoming a career truck driver when a trans-continental job took him all the way to Washington
" 87
"This though has to be the weirdest ," Wax later tells Navidson , right before making his last foray down the hallway
"When Holloway asked me
Karen says a brief hello and leaves to pick the children up from school
Reston makes the necessary introductions and then after everyone has gathered in the living room, Navidson begins to explain what he knows about the hallway
He shows them a map he drew based on his first visit Tellingly, this hardly strikes Tom as news
He shows them a map he drew based on his first visit Tellingly, this hardly strikes Tom as news
While Navidson does his best to impress upon everyone the dangers posed by the tremendous size of that place as well as the need to record in detail every part of the exploration, Tom passes out xerox copies of his brother's diagram
Jed finds it difficult to stop smiling while Wax finds it difficult to stop laughing
Holloway keeps throwing glances at Reston
In spite of the tape he saw, Holloway seems convinced that Navidson has more than a few loose wing nuts jangling around in bis cerebral cortex
But when the four dead bolts are at last unlocked and the hallway door drawn open, the icy darkness instantly slaughters every smile and glance
" he finally asks
"You're about to find out," Navidson replies, sizing up the man, a half-smile on his lips
"Just be carefu l of the shifts
"
From the first time they shake hands on the doorstep, it is obvious to us Navidson and Holloway dislike each other
Neither one says anything critical but both men bristle in each other 's presence
Neither one says anything critical but both men bristle in each other 's presence
Holloway is probably a little unnerved by Navidson's distinguished career
Navidson, no doubt, is privately incensed that he must ask another man to explore his own house

Yet as has already been discussed, the move to Virginia was about repairing their crumbling relationship
Karen would refrain from relying on other men to mollify her insecurities if Navidson curbed his own risk-lust and gave domesticity a real shot
After all, as Karen later intimated, their home was supposed to bring them closer together
89 The appearance of the hallway, however, tests those informal vows
Navidson finds himself constantly itching to leave his family for that place just as Karen discovers old patterns surfacing in herself
Later that evening, Holloway places his hand on Karen's back and makes her laugh with a line the camera never hears

Navidson immediately
88See Newt Kuellster's "The Five and a Half Minute Holloway" in The Holloway Question (San Francisco: Metalambino Inc
bumps Holloway aside with his shoulder, revealing, for one thing, his own easily underestimated strength
Navidson, however, reserves his glare for Karen
She laughs it off but the uneasy energy released recalls Leslie Buckman and Dale Corrdigan's accusations
90
Yet even after Navidson's interjection, Holloway still finds it difficult to keep his eyes off of Karen
Her flirting hardly helps
Her flirting hardly helps
She is bright, extremely sexual, and just as Navidson has always enjoyed danger, she has always thrived on attention
Karen brings the men beers and they go outside with her and light her cigarettes
It matters very little what they say, her eyes always flash, she gives them that famous smile, and sure enough soon they are all doting on her
Navidson confides to his Hi 8," I can't tell you how much I' d like to deviate that fucker' s [Holloway's] septum
" And then later on mutters somewhat enigmatically: "For that I should throw her out
" And then later on mutters somewhat enigmatically: "For that I should throw her out
" Still aside from these comments and the strong nudge he gave Holloway, Navidson refrains from open ly displaying any other signs of jealousy or rage
Unfortunately he also refrains from openly considering the signifi
Furthermore , all his toe nails are horribly cracked, disfigured, and yellow
"Perpetuated," Navidson informs us
"By a nasty fungus two decades worth of doctors finally ended up calling S-T-R-E -S-S
" Sitting by himself on the edge of the tub, blood stained socks draped over the edge, he carefully spreads a silky ointment around what he glibly calls his "light fantastic toe
" It is one of the more naked moments of Navidson, and especially considering its placement in the sequence, seems to reveal in a non-verbal way some of the anxiety Karen's flirtation with Holloway has provoked in him
All of which becomes pretty irrelevant as Holloway soon spends most of his hours leading his team down that lightless hallway
Frequently treatment of the first three explorations has concentrated on the physical aspects of the house
Florencia Calzatti, however, has shown in her compelling book The Fraying of the American Family (New York: Arcade Publishing, 1995)-no longer in print -how these invasions begin to strip the Navidsons of any existing cohesion
It is an interesting examination of the complex variables implicit in any intrusion
90Refer to footnotes 19 and 20 concerning Karen' s infidelities
Perhaps it also should be noted here that for all his wanderings Navidson was pointedly not promiscuous
Good looks, intelligence, and fame did not combine to create an adulterous lifestyle

Considering the time he spent away from home coupled with the kind of offers he got from the most exotic and tantalizing women (not even including those from his numerous female assistants), his refusal proves a nauseating absence of character
Make no mistake about it: over here his kind enter a bar with a smile and leave with a barstool for a hat
" An odd thing to say considering Navidson drank freely in every Australian bar he ever visited and on the one occasion when he was attacked by two drunks, purportedly angry over all the attention the waitresses were lavishing on him, both inebriates left bruised and bleeding

Without focusing too closely on the fine filigree of detail presented in these pieces-a book in itself-it is worthwhile, however briefly, to track the narrative events of the three explorations and recite to some degree how they effect the Navidsons
For Exploration #1, Holloway, Jed and Wax enter the hallway equipped with Hi 8s, down parkas, hats, Gortex gloves, powerful halogen lamps, extra batteries, and a radio to keep in contact with Navidson, Tom and Reston

Navidson ties one end of some fishing line to the hallway door and then hands the spool to Holloway
"There's almost two miles of line here," he tells him
"
Karen says nothing when she hears Navidson make this comment, though she does get up abruptly to go out to the backyard and smoke a cigarette
It is particularly eerie to watch Holloway and his team disappear down the long hallway, while just outside Karen paces back and forth in the light of a September day, oblivious of the space she repeatedly crosses though for whatever reason cannot penetrate
An hour later, Holloway, Jed, and Wax return
When their Hi 8 tapes are replayed in the living room, we watch along with everyone else how a series of lefts eventually leads them to the apparently endless corridor which, again to the left, offers entrance into that huge space where Navidson almost got lost
Though Holloway's ability to shoot this trip hardly compares to the expertise evident in Navidson ' s Exploration A, it is still thrilling to follow the trio as they investigate the darkness

As they quickly discover, the void above them is not infinite
Their flashlights, much more powerlul than Navidson 's, illuminate a ceiling at least two hundred feet high
A little later, at least fifteen hundred feet away, they discover an opposing wall
One -Holloway runs out of fishing line
In fact, he briefly considers setting the spool down, when two-he hears the growl Navidson had warned them about
A little rattled by the sound, Holloway decides to tum back in order to better consider their next move
A little rattled by the sound, Holloway decides to tum back in order to better consider their next move
As Navidson foretold, they soon see for themselves how all the walls have shifted (though not as severely as they had for Navidson )
Fortunately, the changes have not severed the fishing line and the three men find their way back to the living room with relative ease
neon markers
He virtually ignores Navidson, putting Wax in charge of a 35mm camera and instructing Jed on how to collect scratchings from all the walls they pass along the way
Reston provides the dozen or so sample jars
It is almost as if continued use deters the growl and preserves the path they walk
Aside from feeling generally incensed by what he perceives as Holloway's postured authority, Navidson almost goes berserk listening to the discoveries on the radio
Reston and Tom try to cheer him up and to Navidson's credit he tries to act cheerful, but when Jed announces they have crossed what he names the Anteroom and entered what Holloway starts calling the Great Hall, Navidson finds it increasingly more difficult to conjure even a smile

Radio psychologist Fannie Lamkins believes this is a clear cut example of the classic male struggle for dominance:
case in the center which is over two hundred feet in diameter and spirals down into noth
ing, Navidson has to hand Reston the radio, unable to muster another word of support
He has been deprived of the right to name what he inherently understands as his own
93
Lamkins sees Navidson's willingness to obey Karen 's injunction as a sacrifice on par with scarification, "though invisible to Karen
"94
"95
When Holloway plays back the Hi 8s for everyone, Navidson's frustrations get the best of him
He leaves the room
It hardly helps that Karen stays, entirely engrossed in Holloway' s presentation and the ghostly if inadequate images of a banister frozen on the monitor
Tom, actually, pulls her aside and tries to convince her to let Navidson lead the next exploration
"Tom," she replies defensively
what a great toll his brother's death would have on him as well

Instead of scolding him, Navidson helped out
By ten, they had returned home with jars full of light and hands sticky with ice cream
Exploration #3 ends up lasting almost twenty hours
Relying primarily on the team's radio transmissions interspersed with a few clips from the Hi 8s, Navidson relates how Holloway, Jed, and Wax take forty
five minutes to reach the Spiral Staircase only to spend the next seven hours walking down it
86
Even after seeing Navidson's accomplished shots, it is hard to disagree with Holloway
The darkness recreated in a lab or television set does not begin to tell the true story
Rosie O'Donnell, however, offered a different perspective when she wryly remarked on Entertainment Tonight: "The fact that Holloway waited that long to use a compass only goes to show how men-even explorers-sti ll refuse to ask for directions
" 102see Luther Shepard's chapter entitled "The Compass School" in The Complete Feng Shui Guide for 'Ih& NavidsonRecord(New York: Barnes & Noble, 1996), p

With the excep tion of a few weeks in July, he has not worked in over three months
As Tom explains to Karen and Navidson, "the time's come for me to put ass in gear and get on with my life
" He also tells them the time has come for them to contact the media and find a new house
" He also tells them the time has come for them to contact the media and find a new house
Originally Tom had intended to leave right after Exploration #3 but when Navidson begs him to stay through Exploration #4, he agrees
Reston also sticks around
He and Tom both live at the house , Tom in the study ,103 Reston crashing on the pull-out in the living room, while Holloway, Jed, and Wax-at least up until Exploration #4 -stay at a local motel
From all the clips leading up to Exploration #4, we can see how both Navidson and Holloway expect to gain a great deal of fame and fortune
Even if Holloway 's team does not reach the bottom of the staircase, both men agree their story will guarantee them national attention as well as research grants and speaking opportunities
Holloway 's company will more than likely thrive, to say nothing of the reputations of all those involved
This kind of talk, on the day before Exploration #4 is scheduled to start, actually manages to bring Navidson and Holloway a little closer together
There is still a good deal of unspecified tension between them but Holloway warms to discussions of success, especially to the idea of, to use Navidso n's words, "go ing down in history

Nevertheless, what these short clips do not show is the paranoia growing within him
Nevertheless, what these short clips do not show is the paranoia growing within him
As we are well aware, future events will ultimately reveal how much Holloway feared Navidson would get rid of him and thus deprive him of the recognition he had a spent a lifetime trying to obtain, the recognition the house seemed to promise
Of course, Karen will have nothing to do with such talk
She clearly despises anything that might suggest a longer, more protracted relationship with the oddities of their home
Daisy, on the other hand, keeps close to Navidson, picking at tiny scabs on her wrists, always sitting on her father's should ers or when that proves impossib le on Tom's
Chad turns out to be the most problem atic
91
Navidson breaks off his conversation with Holloway to find out what happened
Chad, however, refuses to speak
We're trying to reach the bottom of the stairs
Who knows, if we do that then maybe we'll even discover something before Navidson starts all the hoopla involved with raising

Unlike Explorations # 1 thru #3, for Exploration #4 Holloway decides to take along his rifle
When Navidson asks him "what the hell" he plans to shoot, Holloway replies: "Just in case
"
"
By this point, Navidson has settled on the belief that the persistent growl is probably just a sound generated when the house alters its internal layout
Holloway, however, is not at all in accordance with this assessment
Holloway, however, is not at all in accordance with this assessment
Furthermore, as he pointedly reminds Navidson, he is the team captain and the one responsible for everyone's safety: "With all due respect, since I'm also the one actually going in there, your notions don' t really hold much water with me
" Wax and Jed do not object
"I mean what if you' re wrong
" he asks Navidson
"What if that
You wanna leave us defenseless
" Navidson drops the subject
The question of weapons aside, another big point of concern that comes up is communication
That evening, Holloway, Jed, and Wax move from their motel and camp out in the living room with Reston
Navidson briefs Holloway for the last time on the most efficacious way to handle the cameras
Jed makes a brief call to his fiancee in Seattle and then helps Reston organize the sample jars

If Holloway's hand on Karen had upset Navidson, it is hard to imagine what his reaction would have been had he walked in on this particular moment
However when he finally did see the tape so much had happened, Navidson, by his own admission, felt nothing

The clip of Karen and Wax did not appear in the first release print of The Navidson Record but apparently was edited in a few months later
Miramax never commented on the inclusion nor did anyone else
Perhaps she forgot it was there or planned to destroy it later
Then again perhaps she wanted Navidson to see it
Regardless of her intentions, the shot catches Karen and Wax alone in the kitchen
For some reason both of them speak very softly
On the counter, someone has left a copy of the map Navidson drew following Exploration A Karen occasionally glances over at it
"Did you do that
"
Based on the film, it is impossible for us to tell if Holloway, Jed, or Wax were ever explicitly told not to mention to Karen Navidson's illegal excursion
Wax, however, does not seem to recognize any trespass in his admission
He cleans up the mess instead
A few months later Navidson saw the kiss
By that time Karen was gone along with everyone else
-The Oxford English Dictionary
Billy Reston glides into frame, paying no attention to the equipment which Navidson over the last few weeks has been setting up in the living room, including though not limited to, three monitors, two 3/4" decks, a VHS machine, a Quadra Mac, two Zip drives, an Epson colour printer, an old PC, at least six radio transmitters and receivers, heavy spools of electrical cord, video cable, one 16mm Aniflex , one 16mm Bolex, a Minolta Super 8, as well as additional flashlights, flares, rope, fishing line (anything from braided Dacron to 40 lb multi-strand steel), boxes of extra batteries, assorted tools, compasses twitching to the odd polarities in the house, and a broken megaphone , not to mention surrounding shelves
already loaded with sample jars, graphs, books, and even an old microscope
"
The obvious choice would have been to structure the segment around Holloway's journey but clearly nothing about Navidson is obvious
He keeps his camera trained on Billy who serves now as the expedition's base commander

In grainy 7298 (probably pushed one T-stop), Navidson captures this crippled man expertly maneuvering his wheelchair from radio to tape recorder to computer, his attention never wavering from the team's progress

By concentrating on Reston at the beginning of Exploration #4, Navidson provides a perfect counterpoint to the murky world Holloway navigates

It also further increases our identification with Navidson, who like us, wants nothing more than to penetrate first hand the mystery of that place

Naguib Paredes, however, goes one step further than Clary, passing over questions concerning the structure of anticipation in favor of a slightly different, but perhaps more acute analysis of Navidson's strategy: "First and foremost, this restricted perspective subtly and somewhat cunningly allows Navidson to materialize his own feelings in Reston, a man with fearsome intelligence and energy but who is nonetheless-and tragically I might add-physically handicapped
Not by chance does Navidson shoot Reston's wheelchair in the photographic idiom of a prison: spokes for bars, seat like a cell, glimmering brake resembling some kind of lock

As predicted, by the first night Holloway and the team start to lose radio contact
Navidson reacts by focusing on a family of copper-verdigris coffee cups taking up residence on the floor like settlers on the range while nearby a pile of sunflower seed shells rises out of a bowl like a volcano born on some unseen plate in the Pacific
In the background, the ever
able wind
Considering the grand way these moments are photographed, it almost appears as if Navidson is trying through even the most quotidian objects and events to evoke for us some sense of Holloway' s epic progress
That or participate in it

113Navidson's camera work is an infinitely complex topic
Edwin Minamide in Objects of a Thousand
Facets (Bismark, North Dakota: Shive Stuart Press, 1994), p
421, asserts that such "resonant images," especially those in this instance, conjure up what Holloway could never have achieved: "The fact that Navidson can photograph even the dirtiest blue mugs in a way that reminds us of pilgrims on a quest proves he is the necessary narrator without whom there would be no film; no understanding of the house

Navidson's posture is highly instructive and even enlightening: "His lonely coffee cups, his volcanic bowl
98
There are long conversations, there are long silences
Sometimes Navidson and Tom play Go
Sometimes one reads aloud to Daisy114 while the other assists Chad with some role-playing game on the family computer
Karen keeps clear of the living room, entering only once to retrieve the coffee cups and empty the bowl of sunflower seed shells
When Navidson's camera finds her, she is usually on the phone in the kitchen, the TV volume on high, whispering to her mother, closing the door
But even as the days lose themselves in night and find themselves again come dawn only to drag on to yet more hours of lightless passage, Billy Reston remains vigilant
But even as the days lose themselves in night and find themselves again come dawn only to drag on to yet more hours of lightless passage, Billy Reston remains vigilant
As Navidson shows us, he never loses focus, rarely leaves his post, and constantly monitors the radios, never forgetting the peril Holloway and the team are in
Janice Whitman was right when she noted another extraordinary quality: "Aside from the natural force of his character, his exemplary intellect, and the constant show of concern for those participating in Exploration #4, what I'm still most struck by is [Reston 's] matter of fact treatment of this twisting labyrinth extending into nowhere
of shells, the maze like way equipmen t and furniture are arranged, all reveal how the everyday can contain objects emblematic of what's lyrical and what's epic in our lives
Navidson shows us how a sudden sense of the world, of who or where we are or even what we do not have can be found in even the most ordinary things
"
100
All the images Navidson finds during this period are beautifully
concise
Even the
occasional shot of Navidson himself, pacing around the living room,
communicates the impatience he feels over being denied this extraordinary
A single shot never includes more than one person
Everything seems to be on the verge of breaking apart, whether between Navidson and Karen, the family as a whole, or even the expedition itself
On the seventh day there is still no sign of the team
Ironically enough, it is the call for assistance that eliminates the jump cuts and reintegrates everyone again into a single frame
Navidson has finally been granted the opportunity he has been waiting for all along
Consequently, with Navidson suddenly in charge now, declaring his intent to lead a rescue attempt, the sequence immediately starts to resolve with the elimination of visual tensions

Karen, however, is furious

" Her question is a good one, but unfortunately it only has one answer: because he is the great Will Navidson
"Why does it have to be the great Will Navidson who goes to the rescue
" Her question is a good one, but unfortunately it only has one answer: because he is the great Will Navidson
Considering the circumstances, it does seem a little ludicrous for Karen to expect a man who has thrived his whole life under shell fire and
napalm to turn his back on Holloway and go drink lemonade on the porch
Furthermore, as Navidson points out, "They've been in there almost eight days with water for six
It's three in the morning
" and its adamantine mystery stops Karen cold
Without saying another word, she sits down on the couch and waits for Navidson to finish organizing all the equipment they will need
It talces only thirty minutes to assemble the necessary supplies
If not , the plan is for Reston to go as far as the stairway where he will establish a camp and
handle the radios, serving as a relay between the living room command post and Navidson and Tom who will continue on down the stairs

At first I thought I was seeing things but after I watched SOS more care

Thus while representing the emergency signal sent by Holloway's team, Navidson also uses the dissonance implicit in his home-bound wait-the impatience, frustration, and increasing familial alienation-to figuratively and now literally send out his own cry for help
The irony comes when we realize that Navidson fashioned this piece long after the Holloway disaster occurred but before he made his last plunge into that place

In other words his SOS is entirely without hope
It either comes too late or too early
Navidson, however, knew what he was doing
It is not by accident that the last two short shots of SOS show Karen on the phone, thus providing an acoustic message hidden within the already established visual one: three busy signals, three rings

ICHaving already discussed in Chapter V how echoes serve as an effective means to evaluate physical, emotiona l, and thematic distances present in The Navidson Record, it is now necessary to remark upon their descriptive limitat ions
In essence echoes are confined to large spac~s
In essence echoes are confined to large spac~s
However, in order to conside r how distances within the Navidson house are rad ically distorted , we must addre ss the more complex ideation of convolution , interference, confusion, and even decentric ideas of design and construc
tion
In other words the concept of a labyrinth
It would be fantastic if based on footage from The Navidson Record someone were able to reconstruct a bauplan JLfor the house
Of course this is an impossibility, not only due to the wall-shifts but also the film's con
111
It is too complex to adequately address here; for some, however, this mention alone may prove useful when considering the meaning of 'play', 'origins', and 'ends'-especially when applied to the Navidson house:
Ce centre avail pour fonction non seulement d'orienter et d'equilibrer, d'organiser la structure-on ne peut en elfet penser une structure inorganisee-mais de faire surtout que le principe d'organisation de la structure limite ce que nous pourrions appeler le jeu 131 de la structure
ken or learned
Albert Einstein's work on this matter is also worth studying, though it is important not to forget how Navidson's house ultimately confounds even the labyrinth of the inner ear
133
This not only applies to the house but to the film itself
From the outset of The Navidson Record, we are involved in a labyrinth , meandering from one celluloid cell to the next, trying to peek around the next edit in hopes of finding a solution, a centre, a sense of whole, only to discover another sequence, leading in a completely different direction, a continually devolving discourse, promising the possibility of discovery while all along dissolving into chaotic ambiguities too blurry to ever completely compre
hend
135
In order to fully appreciate the way the ambages unwind, twist only to rewind, and then open up again, whether in Navidson's house or the tilm-quae itinerum ambages occursusque ac recursus inexplicabiles 136-we should look to the etymological inheritance of a word like 'labyrinth'
The Latin labor is akin to the root labi meaning to slip or slide backwards l37 though the commonly perceived meaning suggests difficulty and work
140Therefore anyone lost within must recognize that no one, not even a god or an Other, comprehends the entire maze and so therefore can never offer a definitive answer
Navidson's house seems a perfect example
Due to the wall-shifts and extraordinary size, any way out remains singular and app licable only to those on that path at that particular time
the cloathing is neither Woollen, nor linen, nor silk, sattin or velvet: it is drapery: it is nothing more
"145 Such global appraisal seems perfectly suited for Navidson's house which despite its corridors and rooms of various sizes is nothing more than corridors and rooms, even if sometimes, as John Updike once observed in the course of translating the labyrinth: "The gal
leries seem straight but curve furtively

Eventually Jed tries again to carry Wax toward what he hopes is home
He also attempts periodically to signal Navidson on the radio though never gets a response
Regrettably very little footage exists from this part of the voyage

Karenmay lose herself in resentment and fear, but the Navidson we see seems joyful, even euphoric, as he sets out with Reston and his brother to rescue Holloway and his team
It is almost as if entrance let alone a purpose-any purpose-in the face of those endless and lightless regions is reason enough to rejoice
153
Using 16mm motion picture (colour and B/W) and 35mm stills, Navidson for the first time begins to capture the size and sense of that place

Since rescuing Holloway's team is the prime objective, Navidson
talces very few photographs
156
Eventually when they realize Holloway and his team are nowhere near the Great Hall, the plan becomes for Reston to set up camp at the top of the stairway while Navidson and Tom continue on below

"Navy, I can't go down there," Tom stammers
"
Fortunately, by barely touching his friend's arm, Billy Reston forces Navidson to take a good hard look at his brother
As we can see for ourselves, he is pale, out of breath, and in spite of the cold, sweating profusely
Clearly in no condition to go any further let alone tackle the profound depths of that staircase
157 Navidson takes a deep breath
"Sorry Tom, I didn't mean to snap at
"
But Navidson has already started down the Spiral Staircase
"I should sue the bastard s who designed this house," Reston shouts after him
The dark minutes start to slide by
Based on Holloway's descent, Navidson had estimated the stairway was an incredible thirteen miles down
Less than five minutes later, however, Tom and Reston hear a shout
Tom immediately assumes they have stumbled upon the wrong set of stairs
Further investigation by Navidson , though, reveals the remnants of neon trail markers left by Holloway's team
159
Less than twenty minutes later he reaches the last step
Navidson knows he has no choice but to accept Reston's participa
tion, and heads back up to retrieve the wheelchair and the rest of their gear
Amazingly enough, Tom seems fine camping near the staircase
Both Navidson and Reston hope his presence will enable them to maintain radio contact for a much longer time than Holloway could
Even if they both know the house will still eventually devour their signal
161
As Navidson and Reston head out into the labyrinth, they occasionally come upon pieces of neon marker and shreds of various types of fishing line
Not even multi-strand steel line seems immune to the diminishing effects of that place
Not even multi-strand steel line seems immune to the diminishing effects of that place
"It looks like its impossible to leave a lasting trace here," Navidson observes
"The woman you never want to meet," quips Reston, always managing to keep his wheelchair a little ahead of Navidson
"It looks like its impossible to leave a lasting trace here," Navidson observes
"The woman you never want to meet," quips Reston, always managing to keep his wheelchair a little ahead of Navidson
162
Soon, however, Reston begins to suffer from nausea, and even vomits
Navidson asks him ifhe is sick
Reston shakes his head
163
Navidson speculates Reston's sea sickness or his "mal de mer," as he calls it, may have something to do with the changing nature of the house : "Everything here is constantly shifting
It took Holloway, Jed, and Wax almost four days to reach the bottom of the staircase, and yet we made it down in five minutes
165
If one accepts Dahl's reading, then it follows that Holloway's creature comes from Holloway's mind not the house; the tiny room Wax finds himself trapped within reflects his own state of exhaustion and despair; and Navidson's rapid descent reflects his own knowledge that the Spiral Staircase is not bottomless
As Dr
When Holloway 's team traveled down the stairway, they had no idea if they would find a bottom
Navidson, however, knows the stairs are finite and therefore has far less anxiety about the descent
203See also Dr
What is boredom
Endless repetitions, like, for example, Navidson's corridors and rooms, which are consistently devoid of any Myst-like discoveries ( see Chad; p
9 9  J thus causing us to lose interest
167
Unlike the real world, Navidson' s jour
ney into the house is not just figuratively but literally shortened
This theme of structures altered by perception is not uniquely
observed in The Navidson Record
Almost thirty years ago, Gunter
" Focusing on the constructions of any civilization, whether ancient or modem, it is hard to disagree with him
It is only when focusing on Navidson's house that these assertions begin to blur
171
171
Can Navidson 's house exist without the experience of itself
172
174
Even Michael Leonard, who had never heard of Navidson's house, professed a belief in the "psychological dimensions of space
" Leonard claimed people create a "sensation of space" where the final result "in the perceptual process is a single sensation-a 'feeling' about that particular place
177
Where Navidson ' s house is concerned, subjectivity seems more a matter of degree
The Infinite Corridor, the Anteroom, the Great Hall, and the Spiral Staircase, exist for all, though their respective size and even layout sometimes changes
181
Fortunately Reston's nausea does not last long, and he and Navidson can spend the rest of the day pushing deeper and deeper into the labyrinth
Initially, they follow the scant remains of the first team and then continue on by following their instincts
Initially, they follow the scant remains of the first team and then continue on by following their instincts
Based on the fact that there was very little evidence of the first team's descent remaining on the stairs, Navidson determines that the neon markers and fishing line last at most six days before they are entirely consumed by the house
182
Nevertheless, each agrees to alternately serve as watch
Navidson takes the first shift, spending his time removing the dark blotched gauze around his toes-clearly a painful process-before reapp lying ointment and a fresh dressing
Reston spends his time tinkering with his chair and the mount on the Arriflex
184
It is only as they are making camp for the second night that Navidson hears something
A voice, maybe a cry, but so fleeting were it not for Reston's confirmation, it probably would have been shrugged off as just a high note of the imagination
186
At one point, Navidson manages to get Tom on the radio, only to learn that there is something the matter with Karen
Unfortunately, the signal decays before he can get more details
187
Searching out more hallways, more turns, Navidson eventually
leads the way down a narrow conidor ending with a door
leads the way down a narrow conidor ending with a door
Navidson and
Reston open it only to discover another corridor ending with another door
fifty doors (it is impossible to calculate the exact number due to the jump
cuts), until Navidson discovers for the first and only time a door without a
door knob
189
As Navidson pulls away to re-examine the obstacle, he hears a whimper coming from the other side
Talcing two steps back, he throws his shoulder into the door
190
Reston keeps the chair mounted Arriflex trained on Navidson and while the focus is slightly soft, as the door breaks loose, the frame gracefully accepts Jed's ashen features as he faces what he has come to believe is his final moment
191
191
This whole sequence amounts to a pretty ratty collection of cuts alternating between Jed's Hi 8 and an equally poor view from the 16mm camera and Navidson and Reston's Hi 8s
Nevertheless what matters most here is adequate ly captured: the alchemy of social contact as Jed's rasp of terror almost instantly transforms itself into laughter and sobs of relief
205
Ken Bums has used this particular moment to illustrate why The Navidson Record is so beyond Hollywood: "Not only is it gritty and dirty and raw, but look how the zoom claws after the fleeting fact
Watch how the frame does not, cannot anticipate the action
207
In the next shots-mostly from the Hi 8s-we watch Navidson dragging Wax and Jed out of harm's way while trying at the same time to get Tom on the radio
Reston returns fire with an HK
"Since when did you bring a gun
" Navidson asks, crouching near the door
"Are you kidding me
Which is true: neither one of their flashlight s can effective ly penetrate that far into the black
Navidson grabs his backpack and pulls out his Nikon and the Metz strobe with its parabolic mirror
212
Then just as the strobe captures him lifting the weapon, presumably now aiming at the blinding flash, we hear a series of sharp cracks
Neither Navidson nor Reston have any idea where these sounds are coming from, though gratefully the stills reveal what is happening:
all those doors
" Reston shouts
But Navidson keeps his Nikon steady and focused, the motor
chewing up a whole roll of film as the flash angrily slashes out at the pre
238
Navidson sprints down the corridor to the first door but can find no
way to lock it
Jed 's breathing
" The camera captures Navidson's P
O
239
Whereupon Navidson's eye quickly pans from the thoughtl ess splatter of grey matter and blood to more pressing things, the groan of the living calling him away from the sigh of the dead
240
As we can see, a fever-probably due to the onset of an infection -has marooned him in a delirium and although his rescuers are now at hand his eyes remain fixed on a horizon that is both empty and meaningless
Navidson's shot of Jed , though brief, is not nearly as short as this shot of Wax
241
In the next segment, taken at least fifteen minute s later at a new
location, we see Navidson elevating Wax's legs, cleaning the wound, and
gently feeding him half a tablet of a painkiller, probably meperidine
Reston , meanw hile, finishes converting their two-man tent into a makeshift stretcher
Having already arranged the tent poles in a way that will provide the most support , he now uses some pack straps to create two handles which will enable Navidson to carry the rear end more easily
243
" "Some habits die hard, huh
" "Or they don't die," replies Navidson
218
218
218A bit of dialogue which of courseonly makes sense when Navidson's history is taken into account
219 219see page 332-333
244
A little later, Navidson gets Tom on the radio and tells him to meet them at the bottom of the stairs
245
W hile Karen stayed
home and Will Navidson headed for the front line, Tom spent two nights in no
man's land
erously of a man they admittedly did not know all that well but nonethele ss valued and in some cases appeared to genuinely love
Will Navidson, on the other hand, is respected by thousands but "has never commanded the kind of gut
level affection felt for his twin brother

It probably should be noted that while Ruccalla equates Jacob with Navidson, "the clean-shaven intellectual aggressively claiming his birthright, " and Esau with Tom, "unkempt and slightly lethargic, lumbering through life like some obtuse water buffalo," Nam Eurtton in her piece "All Accurate" in Panegyric, v

18, July 30, 1994 draws the opposite conclusion: "Isn't Navidson a hunter like Esau, actively shooting with his camera
And doesn't Tom's calm, in fact a 2:en-like calm, make him much more similar to Jacob
Ruccalla accepts this risk, recognizing that an investment in such a complex, and without exception, time consuming
Note: Regardless of your take on who's Navidson and who's Tom, here's a quick summary for those unfamiliar with this biblical story about twins
Esau's a hairy, dim
Ironically enough, Tom' s presence in the house on Ash Tree Lane only served to help Will and Karen get along
As Whitten states: "Tom 's desire to reacquire his lost parental figures transmuted Navidson into father and Karen into mother, thus offering one explanation why Tom frequently sought to reduce tension between both

No doubt, what would soon take place deeply influenced the way he treated the material
"
All throughout Tom's Story, Navidson tenderly focuses on Tom's mirth and his ability to play in the halls of hell, those dolorous mansions of Isolation, Fear, and Doubt
He captures his brother trying to help Karen and him with their foundering relationship, and he reveals Tom 's surprising strength in the face of such utter darkness and cold
There is nothing hasty about Tom's Story
Navidson has clearly put an enormous amount of work into these few minutes
Despite obvious technological limitations, the cuts are clean and sound beautifully balanced with the rhythm and order of every shot only serving to intensify even the most ordinary moment

At first everything seems to be proceeding smoothly
Slowly but surely, Navidson draws more and more slack rope down onto the floor, steadily lifting Reston up through the bore of those stairs
Then about half way up, something strange happens: the excess rope at Navidson's feet starts to vanish while the rope he holds begins to slip across his fingers and palms with enough speed to leave a burning gash

By the time Reston reaches the top the rope has gone taut, but the stairway still continues to stretch
Realizing what is about to happen, Navidson makes a desperate grab for the only remaining thread connecting him to home, but he is too late
About ten feet above the last banister
For example, on my way back from the Shop, something strange surfaced
I say "strange" because it doesn't seem connected to anything-nothing my boss said or Navidson did or anything else immediately on my mind
I was just driving towards my place and all of a sudden I realized I was wrong
301
Above him, Navidson hears a faint cry and then nothing
Not even the tiniest hole of light
303
For the final shot of this section, Navidson loads his Arriflex with a 100ft of high-speed tungsten , uses a five minute ultra high intensity lightstick to illuminate the area, and rolls his Hi 8 to record sound

And yet even these violent fantasies were nothing compared to what lay in wait at the centre of the drawing

Lon Lew believes the house enabled Karen to slowly break down her reliance on Navidson, allowing her a greater and more permanent distance : "Her children's fear coupled with their need for her further separated Karen from Navidson
Sadly, it's not the healthiest way to proceed

261
She recognizes that the key to her mis
ery lies in the still unexplored fissure between herself and Navidson
Without knowing it she has already begun her slow turn to face the meaning, or at least one meaning, of the darkness dwelling in the depths of her house
Helen Agallway asserts that by "Monday, October 8th, Karen has made up her mind to depart
When Tom reappears in the living room and informs her that Navidson is only hours away from getting back, she keeps the children home from school because she has every intention of leaving for New York that day
"264
That said, it is crucial to recognize how poor quality and general incoherence is not a reflection of the creator's state of mind
Quite the contrary, Navidson brilliantly used these stylistic discrepancies to further drive home the overwhelming horror and dislocation experienced by his family during "The Evacuation
" For other books devoted specifically to reconstructing
Tom continues to sit with Karen, until eventually her muted cries join the wail of sirens rapidly approaching their house on Ash Tree Lane
While The Navidson Record clearly states that Wax Hook survived, it does not dwell on any of the details following his departure

Right after the release of The Navidson Record, Sheriff Josiah Axnard was accosted by numerous reporters
One clip captures the Sheriff in the process of climbing into his squad car: "For once and for all, that house was completely searched and Holloway Roberts was not in it
When Tom had returned from the grave, he was convinced he had lost his brother
Both he and Reston had heard the great Spiral Staircase yawn beneath them, and Reston's Hi 8 had even caught a glimpse of Navidson 's light sinking, finally vanishing into the deep like a failing star
As Billy explains in The Reston Interview: "Tom felt like a part of him had been ripped away
He takes several deep breaths and then as

" Tom in Tom's Story
tells the "grave-maker" joke, while Reston, during the rescue attempt, admits to Navidson: "You know, I
feel like I'm in a grave
feel like I'm in a grave
" To which Navidson responds, "Makes you wonder what gets buried here
" "Well
Karen returns to her room when she sees Tom and Reston reappear only five minutes later
Even though he too is suffering from Navidson's disappearance, Reston still does his best to counsel Tom, and at least for a few hours Tom successfully resists drinking anything more
Chad apparently had escaped from the house at dawn and now refuses to come in or say a word to his mother
On the third and fourth day, Tom does not emerge once from the study, attempting to drink his grief into submission
Karen, on the other hand, begins to deal with the consequences of Navidson's disappearance
She rapidly starts paying more attention to her children, finally luring Chad back into the house where she can oversee his (and Daisy's) packing efforts
In a brief clip we catch Karen on the phone, presumably with her mother, discussing their imminent departure from Virginia
Reston remains in the living room, frequently attempting to raise Navidson on the radio, though never hearing more than static and white noise
Outside a thunder storm begins to crack and spit rain at the windows
protracted wait, but of course nothing can really diminish the growing
knowledge that Navidson may have vanished for good
Tom eventually returns to the study to try and sleep, but Karen
remains in the living room, occasionally dozing off, often trying to reach
Navidson on the radios, whispering his name like a lullaby or a prayer

change again, until out of the blue, presumably before the cameras can shut
off-no longer ordered to run by the motion detectors-Navidson limps out
of the hallway
immediately kneels beside her, attempting to wake her with the gentlest word
Karen, however, drawn so abruptly from her dreams, cannot arrest the shocked gasp summoned by the sound and sight of Navidson
Of course, the moment she realizes he is not a ghost, her terror dissolves into a hug and a flood of words, awakening everyone in the house
Consider Anita Massine 's comments:
Her initial embrace and happines s is not just about Navidson's return
Karen realizes she has fulfilled her end of the bargain
Her time in that place has come to an end
Navidson's arrival means she can leave
272
Or finally Professor Lyle Macdonough:
The reason Karen cries out when Navidson wakes her has nothing to do with the inherent terror of that hallway or some other cauche
mar
mar
It has only to do with Navidson
Deep down inside, she really does fear him
274
Karen clearly refuses to allow Navidson's appearance to alter her plans
She does not accept that merely his presence entitles him to authority

"Ce ne peut etre que la fin du monde, en avanrant," Rimbaud dryly remarked
Though what exactly was the fire that burned him
As I strain now to see past The Navidson Record
beyond this strange filigree of imperfection, the murmur of Zampano's thoughts, endlessly searching, reaching, but never quite concluding, barely even pausing, a ruin of pieces, gestures and quests, a compulsion brought on by-well that's precisely it, when I look past it all I only get an inkling of what tormented him

JO
Unlike Navidson, Karen does not need to watch the tape twice
She immediately starts dragging suitcases and boxes out into the rain
Reston helps
Navidson does not argue but recognizes that their departure is going to take more than a couple of minutes
"Go to a motel if you want," he tells Karen
56
RouJet also states in his preface: "My friend Diana Neetz at The World of Interiors likes to imagine that the stage is set for Lear, especially with that October storm continuing to boom outside the Navidson's home
"
Only when they have disappeared upstairs does Tom lift up the basinet and pull out a bottle of bourbon
A few minutes later, Navidson enters the living room carrying a load of video tape and film
In all the commotion following his return, he has not yet had a spare moment to spend with his brother
That all changes, however, when he finds Tom on the floor, his head propped up against the couch, enjoying his drink
"Knock it off," Navidson says swiftly, grabbing the alcohol from his brother
"Now is not the time to go on a binge
"
Setting down the box he is carrying, Navidson helps his twin up
"Here, let me make you some coffee
Tom gives a noticeable sigh as he at last leans on his brother
Not till now has he been able to really face the crippling grief Navidson's absence had caused him or for that matter address the enormous relief he now feels knowing his twin did indeed survive
We watch as tears well in his eyes
We watch as tears well in his eyes
Navidson puts his ann around him: "Come on
"
"
"It 's always there for you," Navidson answers, his own cheeks suddenly flushing with emotion as he helps his weaving brother to the kitchen
"That's right," Tom whispers
Followed by another one
Navidson is outside loading a box of Hi 8 cassettes into the car when he sees the upstairs lights in the house go out one by one
A second later Karen screams
340
muffles the sound , but Navidson instinctively recognizes the notes of her distress
As Billy described the scene in The Reston Interview:
As Billy described the scene in The Reston Interview:
Navidson's dehydrated, hasn't eaten shit for two days, and now he's dragging supplies out to the car in the middle of a thunderstorm
Every step he talces hurts
And then Daisy stopped screaming
The next clip of Hi 8 shows Navidson reentering the house, shout
ing for Daisy and Chad as he sprints down the hall, heading toward the stairs in order to get back up to the children's bedroom
Though poorly lit with even poorer resolution, we can see in the
video how Navidson uses the door to get in range of Reston, despite the
fact that the hinges are about to give way
just as the door wrenches loose and tumbles into oblivion
The whole thing does not last more than a handful of seconds, but like Reston, Navidson notes how this brief bit of action still leaves a lasting impression
From The Last Interview:
Those last words in particular may sound a bit glib, especially coming from such an esteemed photographer
Nevertheless, in spite of numerous Hi 8s mounted all over the house, Navidson is right: all the images recorded during this segment are inadequate
Too bad Navidson never holds a camera The entire sequence covering the escape from the house is reminiscent of something taken off of a cheap surveillance system in a local bank or

-Eleven
Reston sits on the grass, soaked to the bone but refusing to take shelter
Karen is still unconscious, lying in the car exactly where Navidson put her
Daisy and Chad, however, are still missing
So for that matter is Tom
Navidson is trying to decide how he should reenter the house when the sound of shattering glass draws him to the backyard
"It was definitely a window breaking" Reston remembers
"
Reston recalls watching Navidson disappear around the house
He had no idea what would happen next
Reston was squinting in the rain, when he suddenly saw a shadow separate from the tree line: "By then dawn had begun to creep in but the storm clouds were still keeping the day pretty dark
" Reston immediately assumed it was Navidson but then as the figure got closer he could see it was much smaller than his friend
"A strange walk too
As we can see, Tom finally finds Daisy frozen in the shadow s
Without a word, he sweeps her up in his arms and races back down to the first floor, avoiding the precipitous drop into the living room-the way Navidson had gone-by dashing instead toward the rear of the house
The whole place keeps shuddering and shaking, walls cracking only to melt back together again, floors fragmenting and buckling, the ceiling suddenly rent by invisible claws, causing moldings to splinter, water pipes to rupture, electrical wires to spit and short out
Cradling Daisy in his arms, Tom starts running as fast as he can, trying to out race the shock of the void yawning up behind them
Ahead, Navidson appears in the window
Tom pushes harder, edging closer and closer, until finally as he gets within reach, he holds Daisy out to Navidson who despite the fragments of glass scratching long bloody lines along his forearms, immediately rips her free of the house and into safety

345
Only the walls and ceiling continue their drunken dance around him, stretching, bending, even tilting
When Navidson returns to the window, he cannot believe his brother is standing still
Unfortunately, as Tom demonstrates, whenever he takes one step foiward, the floor drag s him two steps back
Unfortunately, as Tom demonstrates, whenever he takes one step foiward, the floor drag s him two steps back
Navidson quickly begins to crawl through the window, and oddly enoug h the walls and ceiling almost instantly cease their oscillations
What happen s next happens so fast it is impossib le to realize just how brutal the closure was before it is already over
"Goddamn it Tom, run
" Navidson shouts
And Tom tries, though his effort only sweeps him farther away
This time when he stops, he knows he has no chance
"Hang on, I'm coming to get you ," Navidson yells, as he squeezes
himself all the way onto the kitchen counter
"A w Christ," Tom mutters
Navidson looks up
"What

Tom tumbles into the blackness, not even a scream flung up behind him to mark his fall, Navidson's own scream ineffectually scratching after him, his twin, stole n and finally mocked in silence, not even the sound of Tom hitting the bottom, which is how it might have remained had not some strange and unexpected intrusion, out of the blue, returned Tom 's end in the shape of an awful gasp, heard by Reston, perhaps by Karen who suddenly groaned, and certainly by Chad who crouched among the trees, listening and finally watching over the sobs of his father and little sister until something dark and unknown told him to find his mother
308Due to the darkness and insufferable limitations of the Hi 8s, the chaotic bits of tape representing these events must be supplemented with Billy' s narration
308Due to the darkness and insufferable limitations of the Hi 8s, the chaotic bits of tape representing these events must be supplemented with Billy' s narration
Navidson, however, does not discuss any of these horrific moments in The Last Interview
Instead he makes Reston the sequence's sole authority
This is odd, especially since Reston saw none of it
He is only recounting what Navidson told him himself
1be general consensus has always been that the memory is simply too painful for Navidson to revisit

To\
lrl the end of October, Navidson went up to Lowell to take care of his brother's things
He assured Karen he would join her and the children by the first of November
Instead he flew straight back down to Charlottesville
When Thanksgiving came and went and Navidson still had not made it to New York, Karen called Fowler
Following the release of The Navidson Record, Audrie McCullogh, who helped Karen build the bookshelf, briefly discussed the Navidsons' relationship in a radio interview (a transcript can be obtained by writing to KCRW in Los Angeles)

After Navidson had vanished down the Spiral Staircase, Karen found herself trapped between two thresholds: one leading into the house, the other leading out of it
Even though she finally did succeed in leaving Ash Tree Lane and in some respects Navidson, she was still incapable of entering any sort of dark enclosed place

Even in New York she refused to take subways and always avoided elevators
347
Navidson also refuses to comment, stating only that Karen's already natural fear of that place was worsened by her severe "cl austrophobia
" In The Navidson Record, Karen describes her anxiety in very simple terms: "Gree n lawns in the afternoon, warm I 00 watt bulbs, sunny beaches, all of them, heaven

After a decade of distance, the house was supposed to be a new beginning
Navidson gave up assignments abroad and Karen vowed to concentrate on raising their family
They both wanted and for that matter needed what neither one could really handle
They both wanted and for that matter needed what neither one could really handle
Navidson quickly took refuge in his documentary
Regrettably for Karen, his work was still at home
She needed help
Except in those objects housing evidence of her adultery, Karen's affair with Fowler barely exists in The Navidson Record
It was not until the film began to succeed that details concerning this relationship, however spurious, began to emerge
After all, he was consummately attractive, and even more appealing to Karen, he was stupid
This had taken place when Navidson and Karen were still living in New York City, a year before they bought the house in Virginia
Navidson was off taking aerial pictures of barges off the Norwegian coast

Fowler probably never realized how wrong he was
Not only had Navidson carried Karen out of that house, he had picked her up a hundred times over the course of eleven years and carried her fear, her torment and her distance

They were just a means to escape the closeness of any relationship, particularly the one with the man she loved most
It is pretty certain Navidson knew about "the love letters Karen hid in her jewelry box

As semiotician Clarence Sweeney wrote:

Also reconsider the moment discussed in Chapter II (pages 10-1 l) where Navidson opens the jewelry box and then moments later throws out some of the hair he has just removed from Karen's brush
318 318No matter whether you're an electrician, scholar or dope addict, chances are that somewhere you've still got a letter, postcard or note that's meaningful to you
350
It is safe to assume Navidson knew Karen better than anyone else
No doubt his knowledge of Fowler, the cache of letters, certainly the discovery of Wax and Karen ' s kiss, contributed to bis decision to return to the house for one more exploration
Which was true
Navidson was no longer around, except of course Karen still saw him every day and in a way she had never seen him before-not as a projection of her own insecurities and demons but just as Will Navidson, in flickering light, flung up by a 16mm projector on a paint-white wall

Family portraits are replaced by pictures of tank drivers in Cambodia, peasants hauling empty canisters of nerve gas to the side of the road, children selling soda near body bags smeared with red oil-soaked clay, crowds in Thailand, a murdered man in Israel, the dead in Angola; fractions plucked from the stream, informing the recent decades, sometimes even daring to suggest a whole

Though Karen gives her piece the somewhat faltering title A Brief History Of Who I Love, the use of Navidson 's photos, many of them prize-winning, frequently permits the larger effects of the late 20th century to intrude
Gordon Burke points out the emotional significance of this alignment between personal and cultural pasts:

Each of Navidson's photographs consistently reveals how vehemently he despised life's destruction and how desperately he sought to preserve its fleeting beauties, no matter the circumstances
Karen, however, does not need to point any of this out

The diligence, discipline, and time-consuming research required to fashion this short-there are easily over a hundred edits-allowed Karen for the first time to see Navidson as something other than her own personal fears and projections
She witnessed for herself how much he cherished the human will to persevere
And then quite unexpectedly, she came across the meaning of his privately guarded obsession
While Navidson's work bas many remarkable images of individuals challenging fate, over a third captures the meaning of defeat-those second s after an execution, the charred fingers found in the rubble of a bombed township, or the dull-blue look of eyes which in the final seconds of life could still not muster enough strength to close

Navidson grew increasingly more isolated and obsessed
No consideration, however, has been given to the house as it relates purely to itself

Where objective data is concerned, this was all Navidson had to work with
Once he left the house, however, he began to consider new evidence: namely the collected wall samples
Once he left the house, however, he began to consider new evidence: namely the collected wall samples
In lush colour, Navidson captures those time-honored representa
tions of science: test tubes bubbling with boric acid, reams of computer paper bearing the black-ink weight of analysis, electro n microscopes resurrecting universes out of dust, and mass-spectrometers with retractable Faradays and stationary Balzers humming in some dim approximatio n of life
Various instruments promise answers, even guarantees
Still in order to make sure all this apparatus does not come across as too sterile, Navidson also includes shots of the life-support system: a Krups coffee maker hissing and bubbling, an Oasis poster taped to the vending machine, Homer Simpson on the lounge TV saying something to his brother Herbert
As a favor to Reston, petrologist Mel O'Geery, up at the Princeton geology department, has agreed to donate his spare time and oversee the examination of all the wall samples
Prone toward bird like gestures, he is a slight man who takes great delight in speaking very quickly
For nearly four months, he has analyzed every piece of matter, all the way from A (taken a few feet into the first hallway) to XXXX {taken by Navidson when he found himself alone at the bottom of the Spiral Staircase)
It is not an
371
inexpensive undertaking, and while the university has agreed to fund most of it, apparently Navidson also had to throw in a fair amount himself
337
337The actual sum is never made clear in the film
Tena Leeson estimates Navidson's contributions were anywhere from a few hundred dollars to a few thousand

As O'Geery indicates to Navidson, several of the XXXX samples also appear to have ages predating the formation of the earth
(Though the accuracy of those claims remains hotly contested)

348A possible solution to the date line scheme detailed by Navidson and O'Geery
It certainly lends weight to those theories favoring the historical significance of the samples, though it does nothing to resolve the presence of extraterrestrial and possibly even interstellar matter
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx~
3491berefore Navidson's conclusion seems the only conclusion
Based on the evidence, sample A thru sample XXXX appear to make up an exact chronological map, which though simple, nevertheless still shows that

Navidson asks
Dr
"Nothing peculiar or out of the ordinary
" Navidson presses
O'Geery shakes his head
"Meteors
" Navidson shoots a look at Reston
O'Geery nods, picking up the sample marked VVVV
"
Primarily thanks to O'Geery 's conclusions, some fanatics of The Navidson Record assert that the presence of extremely old cbondrites defmitively proves extra-terrestrial forces constructed the house
Others, however, claim the samples only support the idea that the house on Ash Tree Lane is a self-created portal into some other dimension
In
chapter 13, Keepling credits The Navidson Record with the revival of the Hollow Earth Movement
Tracing this implausible theory from the wobbly ratiocinations of John Cleaves Symmes ( 1779-1829)
objectivity can never adequately address the reality of that place on Ash Tree Lane
Perhaps for us the most significant thing gleaned from this segment is Navidson 's persistent use of all the data353to deny the internal shattering
353See Exhibit Three for all test results, including rubidium-87/strontium-87, potassium-40/argon-40, samarium-147/neodymium-143 dating, as well as a complete set of reports on uranium-235 and -238 contents in lead isotopes
He uses his camera to embrace the Princeton laboratory equipment, seek out the appeasement of numbers, all the while never openly reflecting on the very real absence continuing to penetrate his life
Similar to the way Karen tried to rely on Feng Shui to mitigate the effects of the house, Navidson turns to the time telling tick of radioactive isotopes to deny the darkness eviscerating him from within
Noda Yennard believes the key to this sequence does not exist in any of the test results or geological hypotheses but in the margin of a magazine which, as we can see for ourselves, Navidson idly fills with doodles while waiting for Dr

But even if that is indeed the best way to describe the shape of Navidson's emotional topology, it is still nothing compared to the vision the house ultimately prepares for him

Navidson had a completely different reaction
He could not stop thinking about those corridors and rooms
As we witness for ourselves, following their meeting with Dr
O'Geery, Navidson and Reston both return home
Reston breaks open a bottle of Jack , pours two three-finger glasses and hand s one to his friend

Navidson does not respond
"We can' t do this thing alone
"
Navidson puts his drink down and after a long uncomfortab le silence nods
"Okay , tomorrow morning we' ll call them, we'll send them invita

"Here's to opening things up," Navidson says by way of a toast,
then glancing at the photograph of Karen and the children he keeps by the

The next morning when Reston woke up, Navidson was gone
He had left behind a note of thanks and an envelope for Karen
A day later he drove to the house
Navidson's car sat in the driveway
Reston wheeled himself to the front door
But as Reston eventually found out the house was empty and most startling of all the hallway that had loomed for so long in the east wall was gone
Why Did Navidson Go Back To The House
A great deal of speculation has gone into determining the exact reason why Navidson chose to reenter the house
Why Did Navidson Go Back To The House
A great deal of speculation has gone into determining the exact reason why Navidson chose to reenter the house
It is a question The Navidson Record never deals with specifically and which after several years of intense debate has produced no simple answer
A great deal of speculation has gone into determining the exact reason why Navidson chose to reenter the house
It is a question The Navidson Record never deals with specifically and which after several years of intense debate has produced no simple answer
Currently there are three schools of thought:
tional Cultural Advancement held in Reykjavik, Iceland, Jennifer Kellog and Isabelle Antwerk presented their paper on the meaning and authority of title in the 20th and 21st century
In their study, they cited Navidson as the perfect example of "one dictated by the logic born out of the need to posses s
"
"
Kellog and Antwerk point out how even though Navidson and Karen own the house together (both their names appear on the mortgage), Navidson frequently implies that he is the sole proprietor
As he soaps at Reston during a heated argument on the subject of future explorations: "Let' s not forget that' s my hou se
As he soaps at Reston during a heated argument on the subject of future explorations: "Let' s not forget that' s my hou se
" Kellog and Antwerk regard this possessivenes s as the main reason for Navidson's mind-boggling decision
358While bits and pieces of these readings still circulate, they have yet to appear anywhere in their entirety
to enter the house alone
A month later Norman Paarlberg wryly offered up the following response to the Reykjavik duo: "The obsession just grew and grew until it was Navidson who was finally possessed by some self
destructive notion to go back there and yet completely disposses sed of any rational mechanism to override such an incredibly stupid idea
Kellog and Antwerk argue that the act of returning was an attempt to territorialize and thus preside over that virtually unfathomable space
However, if their claim is correct that Navidson's preoccupation with the house grew solely out of his need to own it, then other behavioral patterns should have followed suit, which was not the case
For instance, Navidson never sought to buy out Karen's share of their home
However, if their claim is correct that Navidson's preoccupation with the house grew solely out of his need to own it, then other behavioral patterns should have followed suit, which was not the case
For instance, Navidson never sought to buy out Karen's share of their home
He refused to lure television programs and other corporate sponsors to his doorstep which would have further enforced his titular position, at least in the eye of the media
Nor did he ever invest himself in any kind paper writing, lectures, or other acts of publicity
And even if Navidson did mentally equate ownership with knowl
edge, as both Kellog and Antwerk assert he did, he should have more adamantly sought to name the aspects of his discoveries, which as others would later observe he most certainly did not
The BFJ Criteria defined ownership as an act of verbal assertion necessarily carried out in public
By refusing to acknowledge The Navidson Record as such an act, The BFJ Criteria could make the question of personal necessity the salient point for rhetorical negotiation
For the first half of its discourse, The BFJ Criteria chose to concen
trate on guilt and grief
Careful consideration was given to Navidson's excessive exposure to traumatic events throughout the world and how he was affected by witnessing scores of "life-snaps" (The language of The Criteria)
Ironically enough, however, it was not until he resigned from those assignments and moved to Ash Tree Lane that death crossed over the threshold and began to roam the halls of his own home
His twin brother died there along with two others whom he had personally welcomed into the house
Losing Tom nearly destroyed Navidson
A fundamental part of himself and his past had suddenly vanished
Even worse, as The BFJ Criteria emphasizes, in the final moments of his life, Tom displayed characteristics entirely atypical of his day to day behavior
Navidson saw his brother in a completely different light
Not at all sluggish or even
remotely afraid, Tom had acted with determination and above all else heroism, carrying Daisy out of harm's way before falling to his death
Navidson cannot forgive himself
As he repeatedly tells Karen over the phone: "I was my brother's keeper
The most controversial claim made by The Bister-Frieden
Josephson contingency is that Navidson began believing darkness could offer something other than itself
Quite cleverly The Criteria first lays the groundwork for its argument by recalling the now famous admonition voiced by Louis Merplat, the renowned speleologist who back in 1899 discovered the Blue Skia Cavern: "Darkness is impossible to remember
"362
The point of recounting these observations is simply to show how understandable it was that for Navidson the impenetrable sweep of that place soon acquired greater meaning simply because, to quote the Criteria directly, "it was full of unheimliche vorklanger363 and thus represented a means to his own personal propitiation
" The sharp-bladed tactics of The BFJCriteria, however, are not so naive as to suddenly embrace Navidson's stated convictions about what he might find

indicting tangle" within Navidson suddenly "lit up," producing projections powerful and painful enough to "occlude, deny, and cover" the only reason for their success in the first place: the blankness of that place, "the utter and perfect blankness
"
It is nevertheless the underlying position of The Bister-Frieden
Josephson Criteria that Navidson in fact relied on such projections in order to deny his increasingly more "powerful and motivating Thanatos
" In the end, he sought nothing less than to see the house exact its annihilating effects on his own being
" In the end, he sought nothing less than to see the house exact its annihilating effects on his own being
Again quoting directly from The Criteria: "Navidson has one deeply acquired organizing perception: there is no hope of survival there
Life is impossible

669, in which she describes her own addiction to The Navidson Record: "I never shook the feeling that the film, while visceral and involving, must pale in comparison to an actual, personal exploration of the house
Still, just as Navidson needed more and more of that endless dark, I too found myself feeling the same way about The Navidson Record

Still, just as Navidson needed more and more of that endless dark, I too found myself feeling the same way about The Navidson Record
In fact as I write this now, I've already seen the film thirty-eight times and have no reason to believe I will stop going to see it
"
The second half of The Bister-Frieden-Josephson Criteria focuses almost entirely on this question of "desire to live" by analyzing in great detail the contents of Navidson's letter to Karen written the night before his departure
To emphasize the potential "desire" for self-destruction, The Criteria supplies for this section the following epigraph:
Thus emphasizing the potentially mortal price for beholding what must lie forever lost in those inky folds
Here The Criteria also points out how Navidson' s previous trespasses, with one exception, were structured around extremely concrete objectives: (1) rescuing the Holloway team; and after sinking down the Staircase (2) returning home
The exception, of course, is the very first visit, where Navidson seeks nothing else but to explore the house, an act which nearly costs him his life

The exception, of course, is the very first visit, where Navidson seeks nothing else but to explore the house, an act which nearly costs him his life
Oddly enough, The Criteria does not acknowledge the risk inherent in (1) and (2)-objective or no objective
Nor does it explain why one trespass/journey should suddenly be treated as two
Because The Bister-Frieden-Josephson Criteria then goes on to treat Navidson's letter in great detail and since its appearance in the film is limited to only a few seconds of screen time, it seems advisable, before further commentary, to reproduce a facsimile here:

The Bister-Frieden-Josephson Criteria pays a great deal of attention to the incoherence present in the letter, the dissatisfaction with the self, and most of all the pain Navidson still feels over the image he burned into the retina of America almost two decades ago
As was already mentioned in Chapter II, before the release of The Navidson Record neither friends nor family nor colleagues knew that Delial was the name Navidso n had given to the starving Sudanese child

For years photojournali sts and friends had wondered who Delial was and why she meant so much to Navidson

Quite a few colleagues accused Navidson of being enigmatic on purpose and so out of spite let the subject drop
Few were disappointed when they learned that Delial referred to the subject of his Pulitzer Prize-winning photograph
And he paid the price too
"369 Lind say Gerknard comme nted, "Navidson ran straight into the brick wall all great photojournalists inevitably run into: why aren't I doing something about this instead of just photographing it
And when you ask that question, you hurt
" 371
Nor did evaluations of Navidson 's burden stop with comme nts made by his associates
Academia soon marched in to interrogate the literary consequence s created by the Delial revelation
Tokiko Dudek comme nted on how "Delia] is to Navidso n what the albatross is to Coleridge' s mariner
In both cases, both men shot their mark only to be haunted by the accomplishme nt, even though Navidson did not actually kill Delia

wood creation, Delial would have appeared at the heart of the house
Like something out of Lost Horizon, dark fields would have given way to Elysian fields, the perfect setting for a musical number with a brightly costumed Delial front and center, drinking Shirley Temples, swinging on the arms of Tom and Jed, backed by a chorus line which would have included Holloway and everyone else in Navidson's life (and our life for that matter) who had ever died
Plenty of rootbeer and summer love375 to go around
376
But The Navidson Record is not a Hollywood creation and through the course of the film Delial appears only once, in Karen 's piece, bordered in black, frozen in place without music or commentary, just Delial: a memory, a photograph, an artifact
To this day the treatment of Delial by The Bister-Frieden-Josephson Criteria is still considered harsh and particularly insensate toward international tragedy
To this day the treatment of Delial by The Bister-Frieden-Josephson Criteria is still considered harsh and particularly insensate toward international tragedy
While Navidson's empathy for the child is not entirely disregarded, The Criteria asserts that she soon exceeded the meaning of her own existence: "Memory, experience, and time turned her bones into a trope for everything Navidson had ever lost
"
"
The BFJ Criteria posits that Delial's prominence in Navidson's last letter is a repressive mechanism enabling him to at least on a symbolic level deal with his nearly inexpressible loss
After all in a very short amount of time Navidson had seen the rape of physics

After all in a very short amount of time Navidson had seen the rape of physics
He had watched one man murder another and then pull the trigger on himself
" His invocation of the memory of the members of the first team as well as others sounds almost like a protracted good-bye
Navidson is tying up loose ends and the reason, or so The BFJ Criteria claims , can be detected in the way he treats the Sudanese girl still haunting his past: "It is no coincidence that as Navidson begins to dwell on Delial he mentions his brother three times: 'I had no one to pass her to
There was no window to pass her through out of harms way
45
374During Exploration #5 Navidson had no illusion about what he would find there
While staring into
" 377
Thus The Bister-Frieden-Josephson Criteria staunchly refutes The Kellog-Antwerk Claim by reiterating its argument that Navidson's return to the house was not at all motivated by the need to possess it but rather "to be obliterated by it
"
Slocum Theory proposed to first focus primarily on "the house itself and its generation of physiological effects
" How this direction would resolve the question of "why Navidson returned to the house alone" they promised to show in due course
Relying on an array of personal interviews, closely inspected secondary sources, and their own observations, the married couple began to carefully adumbrate their findings in what has since become known as The Haven-Slocum Anxiety Scale or more simply as PEER
ttt
10: Will Navidson: obsessive behavior; weight loss; night ter
rors; vivid dreaming accompanied by increased mutism
396
The Haven-Slocum Theory does not lightly pass over Karen's remarkable victory over the effects of the house: "With the eventual exception of Navidson, she was the only one who attempted to process the ramifications of that place
The labor she put into both film shorts resulted in more moderate mood swings, an increase in sleep, and an end to that nettlesome coug h
"
Navidson, however, despite his scientific inquiries and early postulations, finds no relief
He grows quieter and quieter, often wakes up seized by terror, and through Christmas and the New Year starts eating less and less
The house continues to fix his attention
So much so that back in October when Navidson first came across the tape of Wax kissing Karen he hardly responded
He viewed the scene twice, once at regular speed, the second time on fast forward, and then moved on to the rest of the footage without saying a word
He viewed the scene twice, once at regular speed, the second time on fast forward, and then moved on to the rest of the footage without saying a word
From a dramatic point of view we must realize it is a highly anticlimactic moment, but one which, as The Haven-Slocum Theory argues, only serves to further emphasize the level of damage the house had already inflicted upon Navidson: "Normal emotional reactions no longer apply
The pain anyone else would have felt while viewing that screen kiss, in Navidson's case has been blunted by the gros sly disproportionate trauma already caused by the house

In this regard it is in fact a highly climactic, if irregular moment, only because it is so disturbing to watch something so typically meaningful rendered so utterly inconsequential
How tragic to find Navidson so bereft of energy, his usual snap and alacrity of thought replaced by such unyielding torpor
Nothing matters anymore to him, which as more than a handful of people have already observed, is precisely the point
"
Then at the beginning of March, "while tests on the wall samples progre ssed," as The Haven -Slocum Theory observes, Navidson begins to eat again, work out, and though his general reticence continues, Reston still sees Navidson 's new behavior as a change for the better: "I was blind to his intentions
I thought he was starting to deal with Tom 's death, planning to end his separation with Karen
"378
Where The Bister-Frieden-Jo sephson Criteria made Navidson's Jetter to Karen the keystone of its analysis, The Haven-Slocum Theory does away with the document in a footnote, describing it as "drunken babble chock-ful1 of expected expressio ns of grief, re-identification with a lost object, and plenty of transference, having less to do with Navidson 's lost brother and more to do with the maternal absence he endured throughout his life
The desire to save Delia
The desire to save Delia
must partly be attributed to a projection of Navidson's own desire to be cradled by his mother
Therefore his grief fuses his sense of self with his understanding of the other, causing him not only to mourn for the tiny child but for himself as well
397
What The Haven-Slocum Theory treats with greater regard are the three dreams380 Navidson described for us in the Hi 8 journal entries he made that March
Again quoting directly from the Theory: "Far better than words influenced by the depressive effects of alcohol, these intimate glimpses of Navidson's psyche reveal more about why he decided to go back and what may account for the profound physiological consequences that followed once he was inside

" Unfortunately, as her treatment is difficult to find and purportedly exceeds 180 pages, it is only possible to summarize the contents here
As Haven recounts, Navidson 's first dream places him within an enormous concrete chamber
The walls, ceiling, and floor are all veined with mineral deposits and covered in a thin ever-present film of moisture
A dozen people sit on the edge, dangling their feet inside
As Navidson approaches this aperture, he realizes two things: I) he has died and this is some kind of half-way station, and 2) the only way out is down through the well
As he sits on the edge, he beholds a strange and very disconcerting sight
No more than twenty feet below is the surface of an incredibly clear liquid
Navidson presumes it is water though he senses it is somewhat more viscous
By some peculiar quality intrinsic to itself, this liquid does not impede but actually clarifies the impossible vision of what lies beneath: a long shaft descending for miles ultimately opening up into a black bottomless pit which instantly fills Navidson with an almost crippling sense of dread

Suddenly next to him, someone leaps into the well
Fortunately after a few seconds, a violent blue light envelops the figure and transports it somewhere else
Navidson realizes, however, that there are other figures down there who have not been visited by that blue light and are instead writhing in fear as they continue their descent into oblivion
Without anyone telling him, Navidson somehow understands the logic of the place: 1) he can remain in that awful room for as long as he likes, even forever if he chooses-looking around, he can tell that some people have been there for thousands of years-o r he can jump into the

ln the end though, her most important insight concerns Navidson's relationship to the house
The concrete chamber resembles the ashen walls, while the bottomless pit recalls both the Spiral Staircase and the abyss that appeared in his living room the night Tom died
Still what matters most is not some discovery made within those walls but rather within himself
In Haven's words: "The dream seems to suggest that in order for Navidson to properly escape the house he must first reach an understanding about his own life, one he still quite obviously lacks
"
" Since his piece, like Haven's, is also impossible to locate and reportedly well over two hundred pages long, summary will again have to suffice
Slocum retells how in the second dream Navidson finds himself in the centre of a strange town where some sort of feast is in progress
The smell of garlic and beer haunts the air
The smell of garlic and beer haunts the air
Everyone is eating and drinking and Navidson understands that for some undisclosed reason they will now have enough food to last many decades
When the feast finally comes to an end, everyone grabs a candle and begins to march out of the town
When the feast finally comes to an end, everyone grabs a candle and begins to march out of the town
Navidson follows and soon discovers that they are heading for a the hill on which lies the shell of an immense snail
This sight brings with it a new understanding: the town has slain the creature, eaten some of it and preserved the rest
As they enter the enormous wind (as in "to wind something up "), their candlelight illuminates walls that are white as pearl and as opalescent as sea shells
Laughter and joy echoes up the twisting path and Navidson recognizes that everyone has come there to honor and thank the snail
Navidson, however, keeps climbing up through the shell

382 Primarily Slocum concentrates on chapter 5 of Bachelard 's The Poetics of Space as translated by Maria Jolas (Boston: Beacon Press, 1994), choosing to allow Navidson's dream the same consideration literature of its kind receives
For example, Slocum views the question of Navidson's personal growth in tenns of the enigma posed by the snail before it was eventually solved
Here he quotes from the translated Bachelard text:
400
In particular, Slocum's attention is held by Bachelard's parentethical384 reference to his own childhood and presumably the rite of growing up: "How extraordinary to find in those ever expandable brackets such a telling correlation between the answer to the Sphinx's riddle and Navidson's crisis
"
"
Indeed, by continuing to build on Bachelard, Slocum treats the snail in Navidson's dream as a "remarkable inversion" of the house's Spiral Staircase: "Robinet believed that it was by rolling over and over that the snail built its 'staircase
' Thus, the snail's entire house would be a stair
387
Navidson is not the first to envision a snail as large as a village, but what fascinates Slocum more than anything else is the lack of threat in the dream
"Unlike the dread lying in wait at the bottom of the wishing well," Slocum comments
"The snail provides nourishment
Its shell offers the redemption of beauty, and despite Navidson's dying candle, its curves still hold out the promise of even greater illumination
All of which is in stark contrast to the house
"
Slocum contends that the dream planted the seed in Navidson's mind to try a different path, which was exactly what he did do in Exploration #5
Or more accurately:" The dream was the flowering of a seed previously planted by the house in his unconsciousness
Or more accurately:" The dream was the flowering of a seed previously planted by the house in his unconsciousness
" When bringing to a conclusion "At A Snail's Place," Slocum further opens up his analysis to the notion that both dreams, "The Wishing Well" and "The Snail," suggested to Navidson the possibility that he could locate either within himself or" within that vast missing" some emancipatory sense to put to rest his confusions and troubles, even put to rest the confusions and troubles of others, a curative symmetry to last the ages
For the more troubling and by far most terrifying Dream #3, Mia Haven and Lance Slocum team up together to ply the curvatures of that strange stretch of imaginings
tory filled my imagination and dreams when I was a boy
I cannot recall how many times I read and re-read the story of Jonah, and now as I dwell on Navidson's decision to return to the house alone I tum to my Bible and find among those thin pages these lines:
So they took up Jonah, and cast him forth into the sea: and the sea ceased from her raging
(Jonah I: I 5)392
It seems a somewhat bizarre reference, until Haven and Slocum produce a second PEER table documenting what happened once Navidson entered the house on Ash Tree Lane:

Perhaps strangest of all, the consequences of Navidson's journey are still being felt today
In what remains the most controversial aspect of The Haven-Slocum Theory, the concluding paragraphs claim that people not even directly associated with the events on Ash Tree Lane have been affected
In what remains the most controversial aspect of The Haven-Slocum Theory, the concluding paragraphs claim that people not even directly associated with the events on Ash Tree Lane have been affected
The Theory, however, is careful to distinguish between those who have merely seen The Navidson Record and those who have read and written, in some cases extensively, about the film
Apparently, the former group shows very little evidence of any sort of emotional or mental change:" At most, temporary
However, The Haven-Slocum Theory also points out that this course is not without risk
An even greater number of people dwelling on The Navidson Record have shown an increase in obsessiveness, insomnia, and incoherence: "Most of those who chose to abandon their interest soon recovered
A few, however, required counseling and in some instances medication and hospitalization
"
Though Karen and Navidson both went back to Ash Tree Lane, Karen did not go there for the house
As she explains in a video entry: "I' m going because of Navy
During the first week of April, she stayed in close contact with Reston who made the long drive from Charlottesville more than a few times
As we can see for ourselves, Navidson's car never moves from the driveway and the house continues to remain empty
In the living room a closet still stands in place of the hallway, while upstairs the space between the master bedroom and the children's bedroom is lost to a wall
At the start of the second week of April, Karen realizes she will have to leave New York
Daisy and Chad seem to have shaken off the debilitating effects of the house and their grandmother is more than happy to look after them while Karen is gone, believing her daughter's trip will take her one step closer toward selling the house and suing Navidson
On April 9th,Karen heads south to Virginia
"
It is not surprising The Navidson Record does not pause to consider this reference, especially considering that Karen is far more concerned about the house and Navidson' s whereabouts than she is with 17th century history
However having some familiarity with the bloody and painful origins of that particular toe hold in the new world reveals just how old the roots of that house really are
In 1995, parapsychologist Lucinda S
Hausmaninger claimed that Navidson's place was analogous to the blind spot created by the optic nerve in the retina: "It is a place of processing, of sense-making, of seeing
"40 2 However, she soon altered this supposition, describing it as "the omphalos of all we are
405
As everyone knows, instead of delving into the question of location or the history of the Jamestown Colony, The Navidson Record focuses on Alicia Rosenbaum in her dingy little office talking to Karen about her troubles
It may very well be the best response of all: tea, comfort, and social intercourse
Perhaps Rosenbaum's conclusion is even the best: "lord knows why but no one ever seems comfortab le staying there," as if to imply in a larger way that there are some places in this world which no one will ever possess or inhabit
Karen may hate the house but she needs Navidson
When the video tape flickers back to life, it is 9:30 P
Karen actually laughs but her laughter comes up short
Her only hope of finding Navidson had been to confront what terrified her most
Now without a reason to be afraid, Karen suddenly finds herself without a reason to hope
After spending the first few nights at the Days Inn, Karen decides to move back into the house
Reston visits her periodically, and each time he comes they go over every alcove and corner looking for some sign of Navidson
They never find anything
As she has turned back on all the wall mounted Hi 8s and kept them resupplied with fresh tapes, there is ample footage of her hard at work at this task, filling page after page, just as she sometimes fills the house with peals of laughter or now and then the broken notes of a cry
Though she eventually uses up the entire volume, not one word is ever visible in The Navidson Record
To this day the contents of her journal remain a mystery
"
But a few hours after Reston leaves, Karen smiles again, apparently catching somewhere inside her the faint voice of Navidson
This happens over and over again, whether late at night or in the middle of the day
Sometimes Karen calls out to him, sometimes she just wanders from room to room, pushing her ear against walls or floors
Then on the afternoon of May IOtfi, she finds in the children's bedroom, born out of nowhere, Navidson's clothes, remnants of his pack and sleeping bag, and scattered across the floor, from comer to comer, cartridges of fihn, boxes of 16mm, and easily a dozen video tapes
She immediately calls Reston and tells him what has happened, asking him to drive over as soon as he can
On Photography
"Nothing of consequence" was how Navidson described the
quality of the film and tapes rescued from the house
In the eyes of many, the footage from Exploration A offered an exemplary first-look at what lay down the hallway
To Navidson, however, the venture was spoiled by the limited resolution of the Hi 8 and "rid iculous lighting
" Film taken during Exploration #4 was much more successful in capturing the size of that place, though due to the urgency of the mission Navidson only had time for a few shots

"410
Until Exploration #5 there was never a true visual meditation on the house itself, its terrifying proportions and the palpable darkness inhabiting it
The few fragments of usable 16mm and video tape incensed Navidson
In his opinion, very few of the images-even those he was personally responsible for-retained any of those fantastic dimensions intrinsic to that place
In his opinion, very few of the images-even those he was personally responsible for-retained any of those fantastic dimensions intrinsic to that place
All of which begins to explain why in February and March Navidson began to order high speed film, magnesium flares, powerful flashes, and even arranged to rent a thermal video camera
He intentionally kept Reston in the dark, assuming his friend would try to stop him or endanger himself by insisting on going along
418
Throughout his career, Navidson had almost without exception worked alone
He was used to entering areas of conflict by himself
Thuan once said:
Will Navidson is one of this century's finest photographers, but because his work defines him as a "photojournalist" he suffers to this day that most lamentable of critical denuncia
tions: "Hey, he just shoots what happens
411
Only very recently has the detection of a formidable understanding and use of frame balance inherent in all of Navidson's work begun to breach the bias against his profession
Consider for the last time the image that won him the Pulitzer Prize
Consider for the last time the image that won him the Pulitzer Prize
Not even taking into account the courage necessary to travel to Sudan, walk the violent, disease-infested streets, and finally discover this child on some rocky patch of earth-all of which some consider a major part of photography and even art412 -Navidson also had to contend with the
411Personal interview with Timothy K
Or as associate UCLA professor Rudy Snyder speculated: "We would be turned into an impartial audience plunked down in front of history's glass covered proscenium
"413 Instead Navidson kept the vulture to the left and Delial toward the middle, thus purposefully leaving the entire right portion of the frame empty
When Rouhollah W
When Rouhollah W
Leffler reacquainted himself with Navidson's picture in a recent retrospective, he wistfully commented:
It seems people should complain more about this empty space but to my knowl-
4 14
Leffler's point is simply that while Navidson does not physically appear in the frame he still occupies the right side of the photograph
The emptiness there is merely a gnomonic representation of both his presence and influence, challenging the predator for a helpless prize epitomized by the flightless wings of a dying child 's shoulder blades
is not exactly in the centre
She is closer to Navidson, and hence to the observer, by a hair
Many experts attribute this slight imbalance to the large outpouring of national support and the creation of several relief programs which followed the publication of the photograph
Cafiso maintained back in 1985:
Navidson's all consuming interest in people-and usually people caught in ter
rible circumstances-always puts him in direct conflict with death
4 17
As previously mentioned in Chapter XV, Navidson never photographed scenery, but he also never photographed the threat of death without interposing someone else between himself and it
Returning to Ash Tree Lane meant removing the other
Interestingly enough in one of his early footnotes, Cafiso broaches a troubling but highly provocative aesthetic concern when he observes how even "the finest act of seeing is necessarily always the act of llQl seeing something else
" Regrettably he takes this matter no further nor applies it later on to the photographic challenges Navidson ultimately had to face
422
423
Onthe first day of April, Navidson set out on the last exploration of those strange hallways and rooms
The card introduces this sequence as nothing more than Exploration #5
The card introduces this sequence as nothing more than Exploration #5
For recording the adventure, Navidson brought with him a 1962 Hl6 hand crank Bolex 16mm camera along with 16mm, 25mm, 75mm Kern-Paillard lenses and a Bogen tripod
He also carried a Sony microcas
Unfortunately the thermal video camera he had arranged to rent fell through in the last minute
For survival gear, Navidson took with him a rated sleeping bag , a one man tent , ration s for two weeks, 2 five-gallon containers of water, chemical heat packs, flares, high intensity as well as regular inten sity lightsticks, plenty of neon markers, fishing line, three flashlights, one small pumper light, extra batteries, a carbide lamp, matches, toothbrush, stove, change of clothes, an extra sweater, extra socks, toilet paper, a small medical kit, and one book
All of which he carefuJly loaded into a two wheel trailer which he secured to an aluminum-frame mountain bike
He also installed an odometer
As we can see, when Navidson first starts down the hall
way he does not head for the Spiral Staircase
" When he finally stops for the night , the odometer reads an incredible 163 miles
As he sets up camp in a small room, Navidson already knows his
trip is over: "After going downhill for eight hours at nearly 20 mph , it will probably take me six to seven days, maybe more, to get back to where I started from
"
When Navidson wakes up the next morning, he eats a quick breakfast , point s the bike home, and begins what he expects will be an appalling, perhaps impossible, effort
However within a few minutes, he finds he no longer needs to peda l
"
Resigned to his fate, Navidson climbs back on the bike and soon enough finds himself clipping along at almost thirty miles an hour
For the next five days Navidson covers anywhere from 240 to 300 miles at a time, though on the fifth day, in what amounts to an absurd fourteen hour marathon , Navidson logs 428 miles

Navidson's thumb obscures most of the design but the Latin words Fuit Ilium can still be made out along with the English words Thanks To These Puppies
Based on this scant evidence, Staker successfully determined that the matches came from of all places a pub outside of Oxford, England, run by a former classics pro

Unfortunately Staker's calculations are really more a form of academic onanism, a jerk of numeric wishful thinking, having very little to do with the real world
As Navidson reports , he soon begins falling behind
Perhaps his reading slows or the paper burns unevenly or he has bungled the lighting of the next page
Or maybe the words in the book have been arranged in such a way as to make them practically impossible to read
Whatever the reason, Navidson is forced to light the cover of the book as well as the spine
He tries to read faster, inevitably loses some of the text, frequently burns his fingers

In the end Navidson is left with one page and one match
For a long time he waits in darkness and cold, post
Here then is one end: a final act of reading , a final act of consumption
And as the fire rapidly devours the paper, Navidson's eyes frantically sweep down over the text, keep
ing ju st ahead of the necessary immolation , until as he reaches the last few words, flames lick around his hand s, ash peels off into the surrounding emptiness, and then as the fire retreats, dimming, its light suddenly spent, the book is gone leaving nothing behind but invisible traces already dismantled in the dark

As everyone knows, Karen stands there on the brink for several minutes, pointing her flashlight into the darkness and calling out for Navidson

Regardless of what finally enabled her to walk across that threshold, forty-nine minutes later a neighbor saw Karen crying on the front lawn, a pink ribbon in her hair, Navidson cradled in her lap
An ambulance soon arrived
Reston caught up with them at the hospital
Navidson's core temperature had dropped to a frighteningly low
83
7 degrees Fahrenheit
Lacking a cardiopulmonary bypass machine which could have pumped out Navidson's cold blood and replaced it with warm oxygenated blood, doctors instead had to cut into Navidson's abdominal cavity, insert catheters, and proceed to irrigate his internal organs with warm fluid
Though his core temperature rose to 85
Karen stayed at his side that night and through the nights and days which followed, reading to him, singing to him, and when she was tired sleeping on the floor by his bed
As hours slipped into weeks, Navidson began to recover, but the price he paid for living was not cheap

Almost a year and a half has passed since he emerged from the house
constantly needs to sit down to catch her breath
Still, as Navidson tenderly
shows us, her will-o'-the-wisp smiles seem impervious to the ravaging
effects of disease and whenever she laughs the notes sing a call to Victory
Navidson captures all this in simple, warmly lit shots: simmering milk, roasted walnuts and against a backdrop of black ash and pine, Karen's graceful fingers braiding her daughter's long auburn hair
Despite Karen' s infrequently removed woolen hat, she and Daisy still both share a remarkable radiance
graphs hang on the walls of their home
Every room, stairway, and corridor supports pictures of Karen, Daisy, Chad, and Navidson as well as Tom, Reston, Karen's mother, their friends, distant relatives, ancient relatives, even Mallory and Hillary
Though this collage is immensely appealing, Nav idson is wise enough to know he cannot close on such images
They may be heart warming but what they imply rings false
As Navidson says himself: "I kept
looking for assurances, for that gentle ending, but I never found it Maybe because I know that place is still there
"
Navidson has never stopped wrestling with the meaning of his experience
And even though it has literally crippled him, he somehow manages to remain passionate about his work
And even though it has literally crippled him, he somehow manages to remain passionate about his work
Mercifully , in her captivating book on art, culture, and politics, in which she includes The Navidson Record in the spire of her analysis, Daphne Kaplan reminds the reader what it means to be passionate:
Passion has little to do with euphoria and eve

Navidson suffers the responsibilities of his art and conseq uently must tum from the blind comfort found in those neatly framed photograph s filling his home to follow his costume clad children out into the New England streets, their hearts set on sacks of candy, their paths hidden beneath cold coloured leaves
In those final shots, Navidson gives a wink to the genre his work will always resist but invariably join

Halloween
immediately seek out these tiny forms wending their way from porch to porch across great lakes of shadow
Navidson does not close with the caramel covered face of a Casper the friendly ghost
He ends instead on what he knows is true and always will be true
